3,"REASON FOR ADMISSION:,  Intraperitoneal chemotherapy.,HISTORY: , A very pleasant 63-year-old hypertensive, nondiabetic, African-American female with a history of peritoneal mesothelioma.  The patient has received prior intravenous chemotherapy.  Due to some increasing renal insufficiency and difficulties with hydration, it was elected to change her to intraperitoneal therapy.  She had her first course with intraperitoneal cisplatin, which was very difficultly tolerated by her.  Therefore, on the last hospitalization for IP chemo, she was switched to Taxol.  The patient since her last visit has done relatively well.  She had no acute problems and has basically only chronic difficulties.  She has had some decrease in her appetite, although her weight has been stable.  She has had no fever, chills, or sweats.  Activity remains good and she has continued difficulty with depression associated with type 1 bipolar disease.  She had a recent CT scan of the chest and abdomen.  The report showed the following findings.  In the chest, there was a small hiatal hernia and a calcification in the region of the mitral valve.  There was one mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph node.  Several areas of ground-glass opacity were noted in the lower lungs, which were subtle and nonspecific.  No pulmonary masses were noted.  In the abdomen, there were no abnormalities of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and left adrenal gland.  On the right adrenal gland, a 17 x 13 mm right adrenal adenoma was noted.  There were some bilateral renal masses present, which were not optimally evaluated due to noncontrast study.  A hyperdense focus in the lower pole of the left kidney was felt to most probably represent a hemorrhagic renal cyst.  It was unchanged from February and measured 9 mm.  There was again minimal left pelvic/iliac _______ with right and left peritoneal catheters noted and were unremarkable.  Mesenteric nodes were seen, which were similar in appearance to the previous study that was felt somewhat more conspicuous due to opacified bowel adjacent to them.  There was a conglomerate omental mass, which had decreased in volume when compared to previous study, now measuring 8.4 x 1.6 cm.  In the pelvis, there was a small amount of ascites in the right pelvis extending from the inferior right paracolic gutter.  No suspicious osseous lesions were noted.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Norco 10 per 325 one to two p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Levoxyl 75 mcg p.o. daily, Phenergan 25 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. nausea, lorazepam 0.5 mg every 8 hours as needed for anxiety, Ventolin HFA 2 puffs q.6h. p.r.n., Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily, Cymbalta 60 mg p.o. daily, and Restoril 30 mg at bedtime as needed for sleep.,ALLERGIES: , THE PATIENT STATES THAT ON OCCASION LORAZEPAM DOSE PRODUCE HALLUCINATIONS, AND SHE HAD DIFFICULTY TOLERATING ATIVAN.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient's height is 165 cm, weight is 77 kg.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Bilateral cleft lip and bilateral cleft of the palate.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Bilateral cleft lip and bilateral cleft of the palate.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Repair of bilateral cleft of the palate with vomer flaps.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 40 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT THE END OF THE PROCEDURE:,  Stable, extubated, and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 10-month-old baby with a history of a bilateral cleft of the lip and palate.  The patient has undergone cleft lip repair, and she is here today for her cleft palate operation.  We have discussed with the mother the nature of the procedure, risks, and benefits; the risks included but not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, the need for future revision surgeries.  We will proceed with surgery.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position, and general anesthetic was administered.  A prophylactic dose of antibiotics was given.  The patient proceeded to have bilateral PE tube placement by Dr. X, from Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery.  After he was done with his procedure, the head of the bed was turned 90 degrees.  The patient was positioned with a shoulder roll and doughnut.  A Dingman retractor was placed.  The operative area was infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, a total of 3 mL, and then, I proceeded with the prepping and draping.  The patient was prepped and draped.  I proceeded to do the palate repair.  The nature of the palate repair was done in the same way on the both sides.  I will describe one side.  The other side was done exactly in the same manner.  The 2 hemiuvulas are placed, holding from a single hook and infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, triangle in the nasal mucosa was previously marked.  This triangle of nasal mucosa was removed and excised.  This was done on both uvulas.  Then, an incision was done at the level of the palatal cleft at the junction of the nasal and oral mucosa.  A 1-mm cuff of oral mucosa was used to be able to approximate the nasal mucosa better.  Once the incision was done up to the level of the hard palate, the muscle was dissected off the surrounding tissue, 2 mm from the nasal and the oral mucosa.  Then, I proceeded to place an incision at the alveolopalatal junction with the help of 15-blade.  The incision starts at the maxillary tuberosity posteriorly and comes anteriorly at the alveolopalatal junction through the full thickness of mucoperiosteal flap.  Then the flap was lifted up with the help of a freer, and then the remaining of the incision medially was completed.  Hemostasis was achieved with help of electrocautery and Surgicel.  The mucoperiosteal flap was retracted posteriorly with the help of a freer elevator.  The greater auricular foramen was exposed, and the pedicle skeletonized to allow medial retraction of the mucoperiosteal flap.  Then an osteotomy was done at the level of the greater auricular foramen to allow mobilization of the pedicle medially as well as a small incision was done in the periosteum around the pedicle.  The pedicle carefully dissected to allow better mobilization of the mucoperiosteal flap medially.  This procedure was done on both sides in the same manner, and then __________ dissection was done including dissection of the hard palate from the nasal mucosa, it was evident that the nasal mucosa would not reach medially to be placed together.  At this point, the decision was made to proceed with vomer flaps.  The flaps are __________ infiltrated the vomer with the help of lidocaine with epinephrine after an incision in the manner of an open book.  The incision was done with a 15C blade.  The vomer flaps were dissected, and the mucosa was moved laterally to approximate to the nasal mucosa of the hard palate.  This was approximated on both sides with 5-0 chromic running and interrupted stitches, and I proceeded to the remaining of the posterior aspect of the nasal mucosa with a 5-0 chromic and a 4-0 chromic.  Then 2 stitches of 4-0 Vicryl were applied to the soft palate in the Delaire manner through the full thickness of the mucosa and muscle on one side, on the other side, and then coming back on the mucosa to evert the edges of the soft palate.  The remaining part of the soft palate was placed together with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 chromic interrupted stitches.  The throat pack was removed.  The palate was cleaned.  The Dingman retractor was removed, and a single stitch after infiltration of lidocaine without epinephrine at the level of the midline of the tongue was applied with 2-0 silk to the dorsal aspect of the tongue and attached to the right cheek with a piece of Tegaderm.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.  BSS is applied to the eye after removing the Tegaderm.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  The sponge, needle, and instrument count were completed at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.surgery, bilateral cleft, cleft lip, oral mucosa, hard palate, soft palate, vomer flaps, mucoperiosteal flap, nasal mucosa, flaps, cleft, mucosa, palate, mucoperiosteal, bilateral, nasal,"

Complex renal cyst versus renal cell carcinoma or other tumor.,4. Osteoarthritis.,HOSPITAL COURSE:, This is a 77-year-old African-American male who was previously well until he began having gross hematuria and clots passing through his urethra on the day of admission. He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he does have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 years ago. He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended.,He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulties in his activities of daily living, and his Foley was removed on the day of discharge.,He was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course. He is asked to continue the Colace as an outpatient for stool softening for comfort.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:, Colace 100 mg 1 b.i.d.,DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP PLANNING:, The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician at ABCD, Dr. B or Dr. J, the patient is unsure of which, in the next couple weeks. He is to follow up with Dr. G of  Urology in the next week by phone in regards to the patient's MRI and plans for a laparoscopic partial renal resection biopsy. This is scheduled for the week after discharge potentially by Dr. G, and the patient will discuss the exact time later this week.

The patient with extensive smoking history who presents after risks, complications, and consequences of the SCOOP FastTract procedure were explained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to operating suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After this, the patient was then placed under total IV anesthesia and the operating bed was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg.  The patient's sternal notch along with cricoid and thyroid cartilages were noted and palpated and a sternal marker was utilized to mark the cricoid cartilage in the sternal notch.  The midline was also marked and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 at approximately 4 cc total was then utilized to localize the neck.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped with Hibiclens.  A skin incision was then made in the midline with a #15 Bard-Parker in a vertical fashion.  After this, the skin was retracted laterally and a small anterior jugular branch was clamped and cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties.  Further bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization and attention was then drawn down on to the strap muscles.  The patient's sternohyoid muscle was identified and grasped on either side and the midline raphe was identified.  Cauterization was then utilized to take down the midline raphe and further dissection was utilized with the skin hook and stat clamps.  The anterior aspect of the thyroid isthmus was identified and palpation on the cricoid cartilage was performed.  The cricoid cauterization over the cricoid cartilage was obtained with the monopolar cauterization and blunt dissection then was carried along the posterior aspect of the thyroid isthmus.  Stats were then placed on either side of the thyroid isthmus and the mid portion was bisected with the monopolar cauterization.  After this, the patient's anterior trachea was then identified and cleaned with pusher.  After this, the cricoid cartilage along the first and second tracheal rings was identified.  The cricoid hook was placed and the trachea was brought more anteriorly and superiorly.  After this, the patient's head incision was placed below the second tracheal ring with a #15 Bard-Parker.  After this, the patient had a tracheal punch with the SCOOP FastTract kit to create a small 4 mm punch within the tracheal cartilage.  After this, the patient then had a tracheal stent placed within the tracheal punched lumen and the patient was then had the tracheal stent secured to the neck with a Vicryl strap.  After this, the cricoid hook was removed and the patient then had FiO2 on the monitor noted with pulse oximetry of 100%.  The patient was then turned back to the anesthesia and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and will stay in the hospital for approximately 23 hours.  The patient will have the stent guidewire removed with a scoop catheter 11 cm placed.surgery, oxygen dependency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tracheostomy, scoop procedure, nasal cannula, scoop procedure fasttract, thyroid isthmus, cricoid cartilage, isthmus, oxygen, dependency, scoop, cartilages"

Tympanostomy and tube placement.,2.  Adenoidectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the McIvor mouth gag was placed in the oral cavity and a tongue depressor applied.  Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll placed on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction.,Attention was directed to the nasopharynx.  With the Bovie set at 50 coag and the suction Bovie tip on the suction hose, the adenoid bed was fulgurated by beginning at the posterosuperior aspect of the nasopharynx at the apex of the choana placing the tip of the suction cautery deep at the root of the adenoids next to the roof of the nasopharynx and then in a linear fashion making serial passages through the base of the adenoid fossa in parallel lines until the entire nasopharynx and adenoid bed had been fulgurated moving from posterior to anterior.  The McIvor was relaxed and attention was then directed to the ears.,The left external auditory canal was examined under the operating microscope and cleaned of ceruminous debris.,An anteroinferior quadrant tympanostomy incision was made.  Fluid was suctioned from the middle ear space, and a tympanostomy tube was placed at the level of the incision and pushed into position with the Rosen needle.  Cortisporin ear drops were instilled into the canal, and a cotton ball was placed in the external meatus.,By a similar procedure, the opposite tympanostomy and tube placement were accomplished.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.ent - otolaryngology, robinson catheters, palate, tongue, tympanostomy, adenoidectomy, chronic otitis media, oral cavity, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, tube placement, hypertrophy, nasopharynx, adenotonsillar,"

KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty at T12 and L1evels Insertion of KYPHON HV-R bone cement under low pressure at T12 and L1 levels.,2.  Bone biopsy (medically necessary).,ANESTHESIA:, General,COMPLICATIONS:, None,BLOOD LOSS:, Minimal,INDICATIONS:,  Mrs. Smith is a 75-year-old female who has had severe back pain that began approximately three months ago and is debilitating.  She has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modalities including bed rest and analgesics.  She presents with and is on medication therapy for COPD, diabetes and hypertension (other co-morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note).,Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine including T12, L1 and L2.  In addition to the fractures, she presents with kyphotic posture.  Films on 1/04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures.  Films on 2/04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1.  Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1.  The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old.  The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity.  Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed.  The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table.  The back was prepped and draped.  The image intensifier (C-arm) was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker.  In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate.  An 11-gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side.  Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane.  Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed.  A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex.  AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory.  Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision was made.  The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place.  The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle.  Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall.  Through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel.  The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex.  After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex.  The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images.  The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body.  Once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi.  Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position.  The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging.  The final balloon volume was 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left.  There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body.  Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved.  Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement.  The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side.  Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed.,At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12.  An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved.  Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning.,Post-procedure, all incisions were closed with sutures.  The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection.  She was then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor.  She was moving both her lower extremities at this time.,Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications.

She has good flow, excellent physical exam, and now is ready for superficialization of the basilic vein.  After discussing the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient preoperatively, the patient voiced understanding and signed informed consent.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the right arm was circumferentially prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  A longitudinal incision was made from just above the antecubital crease along the medial aspect of the arm overlying the palpable thrill using a 15 blade knife.  The sharp dissection was then used to identify dissection created of the basilic vein from its surrounding tissues.  This was continued and the incision was elongated up the arm as the vein was exposed in a serial fashion.  Branch points were then taken down using multitude of techniques based upon the luminal diameter of the branch before transection.  The basilic vein was ultimately freed in its entirety from just above the antecubital crease to the axilla at the level of the axillary vein.  There was noted to be excellent flow through the vein.  A pocket was then created just lateral to the incision in the subcutaneous tissue.  The vein was then placed into this pocket securing with multiple interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bed of dissection of the basilic vein was then treated with fibrin sealant.  The subcutaneous tissue was then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl sutures in interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl suture for a subcuticular stitch.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  Again, there was noted to be good palpable thrill throughout the superficialized vein.  The patient was then awakened, and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.surgery, end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis, av fistula, brachiobasilic, basilic vein transposition, hemodialysis access, vein, basilic,"

They all consented for the procedure, and the consent was signed and placed on the chart.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to cardiac cath lab where she was monitored throughout all procedure.  The area of the left pectoral deltoid and subclavian area was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  We also scrubbed for approximately eight minutes.  Using lidocaine with epinephrine, the area of the left pectoral deltoid region and subclavian area was then fully anesthetized.  Using an #18 gauge Cook needle, the left subclavian vein was cannulated at two separate sites without difficulty, where two separate guidewires were inserted into the left subclavian vein.  The Cook needles were removed.  Then the guidewires were secured in place with hemostat.  Using a #10 and #15 scalpel blade, a 5 cm horizontal incision was made in the left pectodeltoid groove, where the skin was dissected and blunted on to the pectoralis major muscle.  The skin was then undermined making a pocket for the generator.  The guidewires were then tunneled through the performed pocket.  Subsequently, the atrial and ventricular leads were inserted through each one of the Cordis separately and respectively.  Initially, the ventricular lead was inserted, where a Cordis sheath was placed and the guidewire was removed.  After the thresholds and appropriate position was obtained for the ventricular lead, the Cordis sheath was then inserted for the atrial lead.  After the atrial lead was inserted and appropriately placed and thresholds were obtained, the Cordis was removed and then both leads were sutured in place with pectoralis major muscle with #1-0 silk suture.  The leads were then connected to a pulse generator.  The pocket was then irrigated and cleansed, where then the leads and the generators were inserted into that pocket.  The subcutaneous tissue was then closed with gut sutures and the skin was then closed with #4-0 polychrome sutures using a subcuticular uninterrupted technique.  The area was then cleansed and dry.

Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back was performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and rows #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure.  After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter was placed per urethra into the bladder.  Next, the ultrasound probe was placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum.  An excellent ultrasound image was visualized of the entire prostate, which was re-measured.  Next, the probe template was positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement.  Then 17-gauge needles were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate.  Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra.  Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it was removed.  The CMS urethral warmer was then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted.  After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate was then frozen down to minus 150 degrees for 10 minutes in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior.  The ice ball was monitored and was seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself.  Active warming was then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature.  The urethral warmer was left on after the needles were removed and the patient brought to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition.urology, carcinoma of the prostate, ablation, cystoscopy, cryosurgical ablation, prostate, ultrasound, cryosurgical, urethra, "

We have discussed locations, the nature of trigonocephaly's repair, metopic synostosis repair with bilateral fronto-orbital advancement, forehead reconstruction, and bone graft.  We have discussed risks and benefits.  Risks included, but not limited to risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, need for future revision surgeries, minimal possibility of death, the alternatives, devastating bleeding, anesthesia, death, dehiscence, infection.  The parents understand, decide to proceed with surgery.  Informed consent was obtained and we proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  Prophylactic dose of antibiotic was given.  Lines were placed by Anesthesia and then the head of the bed was turned to 100 degrees.  The patient was once more positioned and padded in the usual manner.  The incision was marked with the help of a marking pen and local anesthetic was infiltrated after prepping the area one time, then the definitive prep and draping of the area was done.,The procedure began with an incision through the full-thickness of the skin into the subcutaneous tissue down to the subgaleal plane.  The subgaleal plane was developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  Hemostasis achieved with electrocautery.  Raney clips were applied to both flaps to prevent significant bleeding.  Then, we proceed with craniotomy part and Dr. Y proceeded with this part of the procedure.  I assisted her and this will be described in a different operative report.  Then, the area corresponding to the C-shaped osteotomy was marked and then we proceed in conjunction with Dr. Y to develop these osteotomies with the help of the Midas by retracting the contents of the skull at the level of the anterior fossa as well as the orbital contents with the help of a ribbon retractor.  The osteotomies were done with the Midas and some irrigation.  There was an osteotomy done at the level of the frontozygomatic suture just posterior to the frontozygomatic suture and then these osteotomies continued down intraorbitally and lateral through the zygoma to the level of the intraorbital rim.  This was done on both sides.  Hemostasis achieved with bone wax and electrocautery.  Once the osteotomies were completed, __________ of the osteotomy sites allowed advancements.  On the left side, there was a minor fracture to the superior orbital rim that was plated.  The bone grafts were customized placing these at the level of the sphenoid bone in the posterior aspect of the orbital rim.  The temporalis muscle was advanced and attached to the orbital rim with holes that have been drilled with Midas and a 3-0 Vicryl interrupted stitches.  The forehead flaps were attached with the help of absorbable mesh.  The forehead portions were applied to the fronto-orbital advancement of fronto-orbital piece with the help of Synthes mesh and 3-mm screws.  Hemostasis was checked.  The flaps were retracted back into position.,The wound was closed with 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures, 4-0 Vicryl interrupted stitches, and 5-0 running fast absorbing gut.  Dressing was applied with Xeroform, bacitracin, and ABDs and a burn net.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

Sharp dissection was performed through the pronator quadratus after which a tissue elevator was used to elevate this tissue.  Next, a reduction was performed placing the distal fragment into appropriate alignment.  This was checked under fluoroscopy, and was noted to be adequately reduced and in appropriate position.  An Acumed Accu-lock plate was placed along the volar aspect of the distal radius.  This was checked under AP and lateral views with C-arm, noted to be in appropriate alignment.  A 3.5-mm cortical screw was placed through the proximal aspect of the plate, positioned it into position.  Two distal locking screws were placed along the plate itself.  The screws were checked under AP and lateral views noting the fracture fragment was well aligned and appropriately reduced with the 2 screws being placed into appropriate position with the appropriate length as well as not being intraarticular.  Four more screws were placed along the distal aspect of the plate and 2 more proximal along the plate.  All locking screws placed into position and had excellent purchase into the bone or had excellent fixation into the plate and maintained the alignment of the fracture.  AP and lateral views were taken of these screw placements again.  None of these screws were into the joint and all had appropriate length into the dorsal cortex.  Two more 3.5 fully threaded cortical screws were placed along the proximal aspect of the plate and had excellent bicortical purchase.  AP and lateral views were taken of the wrist once again showing that this was appropriate reduction of the fracture as well as appropriate placement of the screws.  Bicortical purchase was appreciated and no screws were placed into the joint.  The wound itself was copiously irrigated with saline and Kantrex after which the subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 nylon stitch; 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the wound site after which sterile dressing was placed as well as the volar splint.  The patient was awakened from general anesthetic, transferred to the hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.surgery, open reduction, angulated fracture, distal radius, acumed locking plate, internal fixation, tourniquet, acumed, orif, reduction, fracture, wrist"

2,"CC:, Stable expressive aphasia and decreased vision.,HX:, This 72y/o woman was diagnosed with a left sphenoid wing meningioma on 6/3/80. She was 59 years old at the time and presented with a 6 month history of increasing irritability and left occipital-nuchal headaches. One month prior to that presentation she developed leftward head turning, and 3 days prior to presentation had an episode of severe dysphasia. A HCT (done locally) revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion of the left sphenoid wing. Skull X-rays showed deviation of the pineal to the right. She was transferred to UIHC and was noted to have a normal neurologic exam (per Neurosurgery note). Angiography demonstrated a highly vascular left temporal/sphenoid wing tumor. She under went left temporal craniotomy and ""complete resection"" of the tumor which on pathologic analysis was consistent with a meningioma.,The left sphenoid wing meningioma recurred and was excised 9/25/84. There was regrowth of this tumor seen on HCT, 1985. A 6/88 HCT revealed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma. HCT in 1989 revealed left temporal/sphenoid, left tentorial, and new left frontal lesions. On 2/14/91 she presented with increasing lethargy and difficulty concentrating. A 2/14/91, HCT revealed increased size and surrounding edema of the left frontal meningioma. The left frontal and temporal meningiomas were excised on 2/25/91. These tumors all recurred and a left parietal lesion developed. She underwent resection of the left frontal meningioma on 11/21/91 due to right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness partially resolved and though the speech improved following resection it did not return to normal. In May 1992 she experienced 3 tonic-clonic type seizures, all of which began with a Jacksonian march up the RLE then RUE before generalizing. Her Phenobarbital prophylaxis which she had been taking since her 1980 surgery was increased. On 12/7/92, she underwent a left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital craniotomy and excision of five meningiomas. Postoperatively she developed worsened right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness and aphasia improved by 3/93, but never returned to normal.consult - history and phy., sphenoid wing meningioma, sphenoid wing, expressive aphasia, meningiomas, aphasia, sphenoidNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

Her MRI showed stenosis at portion of C4 to C6.  I discussed the procedure as well as risks and complications.  She wishes to proceed with surgery.  Risks will include but are not limited to infection, hemorrhage, spinal fluid leak, worsened neurologic deficit, recurrent stenosis, requiring further surgery, difficulty with fusion requiring further surgery, long-term hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, medical anesthesia risk.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room on 10/02/2007.  She was intubated for anesthesia.  TEDS and boots as well as Foley catheter were placed.  She was placed in a supine position with her neck in neutral position.  Appropriate pads were also used.  The area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative localization was taken.  _____ not changed.  Incision was made on the right side in transverse fashion over C5 vertebral body level.  This was made with a #10 blade knife and further taken down with pickups and scissors.  The plane between the esophagus and carotid artery was carefully dissected both bluntly and sharply down to the anterior aspect of the cervical spine.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken.  Longus colli muscles were retracted laterally.  Caspar retractors were used.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken.  I first turned by attention at C5-C6 interspace.  This was opened with #15 blade knife.  Disc material was taken out using pituitary as well as Kerrison rongeur.  Anterior aspects were taken down.  End plates were arthrodesed using curettes.  This was done under distraction.  Posterior longitudinal ligament was opened with a nerve hook and Kerrison rongeur.  Bilateral foraminotomies were done.  At this point, I felt that there was a good decompression.  The foramen appeared to be opened.  Medtronic cage was then encountered and sent few millimeters.  This was packed with demineralized bone matrix.  The distraction was then taken down.  The cage appeared to be strong.  This procedure was then repeated at C4-C5.  A 42-mm AcuFix plate was then placed between C4 and C6.  This was carefully screwed and locked.  The instrumentation appeared to be strong.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken.  Irrigation was used.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The platysmas was closed with 3-0 Vicryl stitches.  The subcutaneous was closed with 4-0 Vicryl stitches.  The skin was closed with Steri-strips.  The area was clean and dry and dressed with Telfa and Tegaderm.

2,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome.  The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 275 pounds.  Food records were reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.,PLAN:,  A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.  Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day.  This was a half hour consultation.  We will plan to see the patient back in one month for support.consult - history and phy., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, meal, food records, south beach diet, dietary consultation, meal plan, carbohydrates, snack, dietary, calories, weight"
1,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,This is an 83-year-old woman referred for diagnostic lumbar puncture for possible malignancy by Dr. X. She is accompanied by her daughter.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient' daughter tells me that over the last month the patient has gradually stopped walking even with her walker and her left arm has become gradually less functional.  She is not able to use the walker because her left arm is so weak.  She has not been having any headaches.  She has had a significant decrease in appetite.  She is known to have lung cancer, but Ms. Wilson does not know what kind.  According to her followup notes, it is presumed non-small cell lung cancer of the left upper lobe of the lung.  The last note I have to evaluate is from October 2008.  CT scan from 12/01/2009 shows atrophy and small vessel ischemic change, otherwise a normal head CT, no mass lesion.  I also reviewed the MRI from September 2009, which does not suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus and shows no mass lesion.,Blood tests from 11/18/2009 demonstrate platelet count at 132 and INR of 1.0.,MAJOR FINDINGS: , The patient is a pleasant and cooperative woman who answers the questions the best she can and has difficulty moving her left arm and hand.  She also has pain in her left arm and hand at a level of 8-9/10.,VITAL SIGNS: , Blood pressure 126/88, heart rate 70, respiratory rate 16, and weight 95 pounds.,I screened the patient with questions to determine whether it is likely she has abnormal CSF pressure and she does not have any of the signs that would suggest this, so we performed the procedure in the upright position.,PROCEDURE:,  Lumbar puncture, diagnostic (CPT 62270).,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Possible CSF malignancy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,To be determined after CSF evaluation.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Lumbar puncture.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with 2% lidocaine at the L4-L5 level.,SPECIMEN REMOVED:  ,15 cc of clear CSF.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,I explained the procedure, its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the patient and her daughter.  The patient' daughter remained present throughout the procedure.  The patient provided written consent and her daughter signed as witness to the consent.,I located the iliac crest and spinous processes before the procedure and determined the level I planned for the puncture.  During the procedure, I spoke constantly with the patient to explain what was happening and to warn when there might be pain or discomfort.  The skin was prepped with chlorhexidine solution with the patient seated on the chair leaning forward with her face resting on the exam table.  Using local anesthetic and aseptic technique, I inserted a 20-gauge spinal needle at the L4-L5 interspace and 15 cc of CSF was collected without difficulty.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.,ASSESSMENT:  ,White blood cells 1, red blood cells 54, glucose 59, protein 51, Gram stain negative, bacterial culture negative after three days, and remaining tests pending.nan"
2,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Gram-negative rod bacteremia, final identification and susceptibilities still pending.,2.

History of urinary tract infections of pyelonephritis.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED: , Chest x-ray July 24, 2007, that was normal.  Transesophageal echocardiogram July 27, 2007, that was normal.  No evidence of vegetations.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis July 27, 2007, that revealed multiple small cysts in the liver, the largest measuring 9 mm.  There were 2-3 additional tiny cysts in the right lobe.  The remainder of the CT scan was normal.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Briefly, the patient is a 26-year-old white female with a history of fevers.  For further details of the admission, please see the previously dictated history and physical.  ,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Gram-negative rod bacteremia.  The patient was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of endocarditis given the fact that she had fever, septicemia, and Osler nodes on her fingers.  The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram as an outpatient, which was equivocal, but a transesophageal echocardiogram here in the hospital was normal with no evidence of vegetations.  The microbiology laboratory stated that the Gram-negative rod appeared to be anaerobic, thus raising the possibility of organisms like bacteroides.  The patient does have a history of congenital genitourinary abnormalities which were surgically corrected before the fifth grade.  We did a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which only showed some benign appearing cysts in the liver.  There was nothing remarkable as far as her kidneys, ureters, or bladder were concerned.  I spoke with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases, and Dr. XYZ asked me to talk to the patient about any contact with animals, given the fact that we have had a recent outbreak of tularemia here in Utah.  Much to my surprise, the patient told me that she had multiple pet rats at home, which she was constantly in contact with.  I ordered tularemia and leptospirosis serologies on the advice of Dr. XYZ, and as of the day after discharge, the results of the microbiology still are not back yet.  The patient, however, appeared to be responding well to levofloxacin.  I gave her a 2-week course of 750 mg a day of levofloxacin, and I have instructed her to follow up with Dr. XYZ in the meantime.  Hopefully by then we will have a final identification and susceptibility on the organism and the tularemia and leptospirosis serologies will return.  A thought of ours was to add doxycycline, but again the patient clinically appeared to be responding to the levofloxacin.  In addition, I told the patient that it would be my recommendation to get rid of the rats.  I told her that if indeed the rats were carriers of infection and she received a zoonotic infection from exposure to the rats, that she could be in ongoing continuing danger and her children could also potentially be exposed to a potentially lethal infection.  I told her very clearly that she should, indeed, get rid of the animals.  The patient seemed reluctant to do so at first, but I believe with some coercion from her family, that she finally came to the realization that this was a recommendation worth following.,  ,DISPOSITION,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Activity is as tolerated.  Diet is as tolerated.,MEDICATIONS: , Levaquin 750 mg daily x14 days.,Followup is with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases.  I gave the patient the phone number to call on Monday for an appointment.  Additional followup is also with Dr. XYZ, her primary care physician.  Please note that 40 minutes was spent in the discharge.discharge summary, abdomen and pelvis, gram negative rod, congenital genitourinary, genitourinary abnormalities, transesophageal echocardiogram, infectious diseases, leptospirosis serologies, gram negative, ct scan, identification, infections, levofloxacin, additional, discharge"

4,"PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left cervical radiculopathy at C5, C6,OPERATION: , Left C5-6 hemilaminotomy and foraminotomy with medial facetectomy for microscopic decompression of nerve root.,After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was taken to the OR.  After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted.  At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine.  A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated.  After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken.  This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level.  Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified.  After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken.  This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time.  At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina.  The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe.  This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur.  However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone.  Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area.  After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur.  At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed.  However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade.  Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery.  After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin.  Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches.  The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon.  The skin was reapproximated using a running 000 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient was then extubated in the OR and transferred to the Recovery room in stable condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  minimal.orthopedic, foraminotomy with medial facetectomy, facetectomy for microscopic decompression, decompression of nerve root, hemilaminotomy and foraminotomy, decompression of nerve, microscopic decompression, medial facetectomy, kerrison rongeur, nerve root, spinous processes, facetectomy, kerrison, hemilaminotomy, foraminotomy,"

The preparation was good and all surfaces were well seen.  The hypopharynx was normal with no evidence of inflammation.  The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout with no sign of stricturing or inflammation or exudate.  The GE junction was located at 39 cm from the incisors and appeared normal with no evidence of reflux, damage, or Barrett's.  Below this there was a small gastric pouch measuring 6 cm with intact mucosa and no retained food.  The gastrojejunal anastomosis was patent measuring about 12 mm, with no inflammation or ulceration.  Beyond this there was a side-to-side gastrojejunal anastomosis with a short afferent blind end and a normal efferent end with no sign of obstruction or inflammation.  The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room.  She tolerated the procedure well.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Normal post-gastric bypass anatomy.,2.

A Hulka cannula was inserted into the cervix and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.,An infraumbilical incision was made with the knife.  A Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen.  Intraperitoneal location was verified with approximately 10 cc of sterile solution.  A pneumoperitoneum was created.  The Veress needle was then removed, and a trocar was inserted directly without difficulty.  Intraperitoneal location was verified visually with the laparoscope.  There was no evidence of any intra-abdominal trauma.,Each fallopian tube was elevated with a Falope ring applicator, and a Falope ring was placed on each tube with a 1-cm to 1.5-cm portion of the tube above the Falope ring.,The pneumoperitoneum was evacuated, and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  An attempt was made to close the fascia with a figure-of-eight suture.  However, this was felt to be more subcutaneous.

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected only in a subplatysmal manner bluntly, and with only blunt dissection at the prevertebral space where a localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained, once self-retaining retractors were placed along the mesial edge of a cauterized longus colli muscle, to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case.  A prominent anterior osteophyte at C5-C6 was then localized, compared to preoperative studies in the usual fashion intraoperatively, and the osteophyte was excised with a rongeur and bony fragments saved.  This allowed for an annulotomy, which was carried out with a #11 blade and discectomy, removed with straight disc forceps portions of the disc, which were sent to Pathology for a permanent section.  Residual osteophytes and disc fragments were removed with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs as necessary as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements widely laterally as well.  A hypertrophied ligament and prominent posterior spurs were excised as well until the dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status.  At no time during the case was evidence of CSF leakage, and hemostasis was readily achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.  Once the decompression was inspected with a double ball dissector and all found to be completely decompressed, and the dura bulged at the interspace, and pulsated, then a Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and fusion putty and countersunk into position, and was quite tightly applied.  Further stability was added nonetheless with an appropriate size Uniplate, which was placed of appropriate size with appropriate size screws and these were locked into place in the usual manner.  The wound was inspected, and irrigated again with antibiotic solution and after further inspection was finally closed in a routine closure in a multiple layer event by first approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was Steri-Stripped for reinforcement, and a sterile dressing was applied, incorporating a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in the usual manner.  Once the sterile dressing was applied, the patient was taken from the operating room to the recovery area having left in stable condition.,At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type.orthopedic, herniated nucleus pulposus, myelopathy, cervical spondylosis, cervical stenosis, anterior instrumentation, uniplate, decompression, anterior cervical discectomy, spinal cord, spinal canal, sterile dressing, interbody fusion, bengal cage, interbody, cervical, anterior, discectomy,"
2,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.,MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:,1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.,4.

IT IS LISTED THAT TOPROL HAS CAUSED SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN HER OFFICE CHART AND I BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT BRADYCARDIA WITH THAT IN THE PAST.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, nor use any illicit drugs.  She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding, stomach ulcers.  She does not recall renal calculi, nor cholelithiasis, denies asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, sleep apnea, home oxygen use.  She does note occasional peripheral edema.  She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAM:  ,Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.emergency room reports, hypokalemia, shortness of breath, atrial tachycardia, sinus rhythm, hip fracture, atrial, tachycardia, rhythm, apcs, cardiac, regurgitation, aortic, hypertension, pulmonary, "
2,"Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck.  The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer.  He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember.  He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005.  At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2.  This was done on 12/15/2005.  Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required.  He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal.  The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center.  At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations.  He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis.  This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist.  It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs.  Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time.  In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program.  The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  Evaluation was done by Dr. B.  At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco.  These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited.  He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero.  The patient denies smoking at this time.  He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  He obtains no pain medications from no other sources.  Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.  There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient does not know what medications he is taking for diabetes and denies any diabetes.  CABG in July of 2006 with no preoperative angina, shortness of breath, or myocardial infarction.  History of depression, lumbar fusion surgery in 2000, left knee surgery 25 years ago.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is on disability.  He does not smoke.  He does not drink alcohol.  He is single.  He lives with a girlfriend.  He has minimal activities of daily living.

Depressive symptoms of crying and decreased self-worth have been noted in the past.  No neurological history of strokes, epileptic seizures.  Genitourinary negative.  Gastrointestinal negative.  Integumentary negative.  Behavioral, depression.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is short of hearing.  His cognitive skills appear to be significantly impaired.  The patient is oriented x3 to time and place.  Weight 185 pounds, temperature 97.5, blood pressure 137/92, pulse 61.  The patient is complaining of pain of a 9/10.,Musculoskeletal:  The patient's gait is markedly antalgic with predominant weightbearing on the left leg.  There is marked postural deviation to the left.  Because of pain, the patient is unable to heel-toe or tandem gait.  Examination of the neck and cervical spine are within normal limits.  Range of motion of the elbow, shoulders are within normal limits.  No muscle spasm or abnormal muscle movements noted in the neck and upper extremities.  Head is normocephalic.  Examination of the anterior neck is within normal limits.  There is significant muscle wasting of the quadriceps and hamstrings on the left, as well as of the calf muscles.  Skin is normal.  Hair distribution normal.  Skin temperature normal in both the upper and lower extremities.  The lumbar spine curvature is markedly flattened.  There is a well-healed central scar extending from T12 to L1.  The patient exhibits numerous positive Waddell's signs on exam of the low back with inappropriate flinching and wincing with even the lightest touch on the paraspinal muscles.  Examination of the paraspinal muscles show a mild to moderate degree of spasm with a significant degree of tenderness and guarding, worse on the left than the right.  Range of motion testing of the lumbar spine is labored in all directions.  It is interesting that the patient cannot flex more than 5  in the standing position, but is able to sit without any problem.  There is a marked degree of sciatic notch tenderness on the left.  No abnormal muscle spasms or muscle movements were noted.  Patrick's test is negative bilaterally.  There are no provocative facetal signs in either the left or right quadrants of the lumbar area.  Neurological exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII are within normal limits.  Neurological exam of the upper extremities is within normal limits with good motor strength and normal biceps, triceps and brachioradialis reflexes.  Neurological exam of the lower extremities shows a 2+ right patellar reflex and -1 on the left.  There is no ankle clonus.  Babinski is negative.  Sensory testing shows a minimal degree of sensory loss on the right L5 distribution.  Muscle testing shows decreased L4-L5 on the left with extensor hallucis longus +2/5.  Ankle extensors are -3 on the left and +5 on the right.  Dorsiflexors of the left ankle are +2 on the left and +5 on the right.  Straight leg raising test is positive on the left at about 35 .

I do not think this patient is a good candidate for spinal cord stimulation due to his grasp of exactly what is happening and his cognitive impairment.  I will get a behavioral evaluation from Mr. Tom Welbeck and refer the patient for ongoing physical therapy.

Vertebroplasties at T7 and T9 with insertion of prosthetic device.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with sedation.,SPECIMEN: , Bone from the T8 vertebra.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,SURGICAL INDICATIONS:,  The patient is an 80-year-old female who had previous history of compression fractures.  She had recently undergone an additional compression fracture of the T8 vertebrae.  She was in extreme pain.  This pain interfered with activities of daily living and was unimproved with conservative treatment modalities.  She is understanding the risks, benefits, and potential complications as well as all treatment alternatives.  The patient provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #2 where she was placed prone on the Jackson spinal table.  She was given sedative.  The thoracodorsal spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Biplanar image intensification was utilized to localize the T8, T7, and T9 vertebrae.  Local anesthetic of 1% Marcaine with epinephrine and lidocaine were 50:50 mixed.,Approximately 7 cc was instilled on the left side.  This was directly over the posterior aspect of the pedicle on the left.  Once this was localized, the right side was localized as well.  Stab incisions were then created over the pedicles of T8 bilaterally.  Jamshidi needles were then placed percutaneously.  Their position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  They were advanced slowly under direct image intensification in biplanar fashion.  Once these were satisfactorily placed, the inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was inserted into the depths of the T7 vertebrae.  The Jamshidi needles were then removed.  A biopsy was then harvested with a biopsy trocar placed into the T8 vertebrae.  This bone was then removed and sent to the lab.  The injection cannulas were then placed over the guidewires and their position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, a second Jamshidi needle was placed at the T7 vertebrae on the left at the entrance of the pedicle.  This was advanced under direct image intensification in a biplanar fashion.  Once this was deemed satisfactory, it was impacted.  The inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was then placed.  An injection cannula was then placed over the guidewire into the body of T7.  In a similar fashion, T9 was dressed on the left side as well.  A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, which was verified in both AP and lateral images.  The cement injection cannula was then placed over this entering the T9 vertebrae body.  Attention was then turned to the kyphoplasty portion of the procedure at the T8 vertebrae.  The balloons were inserted bilaterally.  The balloons were then inflated under direct image intensification and pressurized to approximately 200 mmHg.  These were allowed to expand and reduce the fracture.  Once this was completed, the balloons were deflated and removed.  The inner cannulas of all four entrance holes were removed and approximately 1.5 cc of cement was injected in each of the cannulas.  This was done directly under image intensification.  Once this was completed, additional cement was injected into T9 as there was a larger vertebra.  The cement was allowed to cure.  The cannula was removed and final radiographs were obtained.  The stab incisions were then cleansed with water and antibiotic irrigation.  The wounds were then approximated with #4-0 Nylon in interrupted fashion.  Compression dressings were applied and fixed with tape.  She was aroused and moved to her inpatient bed.  She was moving all four extremities without deficit.

Laparoscopic bilateral partial salpingectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Less than 50 cc.,SPECIMEN: , Portions of bilateral fallopian tubes.,INDICATIONS:,  This is a 30-year-old female gravida 4, para-3-0-1-3 who desires permanent sterilization.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the uterus is small, anteverted, and freely mobile.  There are no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.  The liver margin and bowel appeared normal.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 7 cm.,The cervix was serially dilated with Hank dilators.  A #20 Hank dilator was left in place.  The sterile speculum was then removed.  Gloves were changed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately a 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made through the patient's previous scar.  The Veress needle was placed and gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and the camera was placed with the above findings noted.  Two 5 mm step trocars were placed, one 2 cm superior to the pubic bone along the midline and the other approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the left at the level of the umbilicus.  The Endoloop was placed through the left-sided port.  A grasper was placed in the suprapubic port and put through the Endoloop and then a portion of the left tube was identified and grasped with a grasper.  A knuckle of tube was brought up with the grasper and a #0 Vicryl Endoloop synched down across this knuckle of tube.  The suture was then cut using the endoscopic shears.  The portion of tube that was tied off was removed using a Harmonic scalpel.  This was then removed from the abdomen and sent to Pathology.  The right tube was then identified and in a similar fashion, the grasper was placed through the loop of the #0 Vicryl Endoloop and the right tube was grasped with the grasper and the knuckle of tube was brought up into the loop.  The loop was then synched down.  The Endoshears were used to cut the suture.  The Harmonic scalpel was then used to remove that portion of tube.  The portion of the tube that was removed from the abdomen was sent to Pathology.  Both tubes were examined and found to have excellent hemostasis.  All instruments were then removed.  The 5 mm ports were removed with good hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar was removed.  The fascia of the infraumbilical incision was reapproximated with an interrupted suture of #3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of Marcaine was injected at the incision site.  The vulsellum tenaculum and cervical dilator were then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  She will be discharged home with a prescription for Vicodin for pain and was instructed to follow up in the office in two weeks.surgery, cervical dilatation, partial salpingectomy, permanent sterilization, vulsellum tenaculum, hank dilators, infraumbilical incision, vicryl endoloop, salpingectomy, dilatation, hemostasis, cervical, laparoscopic, endoloop, sterilization,"
1,"PROCEDURE:,  Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , A 92-year-old lady with history of dysphagia on and off for two years.  She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva.  This started almost a day earlier.  She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything.  She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , Informed consent was obtained from patient.  The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed.  Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks.  Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus.  There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus.  This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots.  The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation.  Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.,The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation.  Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net.  Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft.  Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out.  Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully.  The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy.  No active bleeding was seen.  There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach.  As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.,IMPRESSION: , Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.  Treated as described above.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  IV Protonix 40 mg q.12h.  Clear liquid diet for 24 hours.  If the patient is stable, thereafter she may take soft pureed diet only until next endoscopy, which will be scheduled in three to four weeks.  She should take Prevacid SoluTab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge.surgery, dysphagia, removal of food impaction, distal esophagus, stomach, distal esophageal, esophageal stricture, upper endoscopy, food impaction, endoscopy, aspiration, sedation, bolus, impaction, esophagus, "

2,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Patient is a 72-year-old white male complaining of a wooden splinter lodged beneath his left fifth fingernail, sustained at 4 p.m. yesterday.  He attempted to remove it with tweezers at home, but was unsuccessful.  He is requesting we attempt to remove this for him.,The patient believes it has been over 10 years since his last tetanus shot, but states he has been allergic to previous immunizations primarily with ""horse serum.""  Consequently, he has declined to update his tetanus immunization.,MEDICATIONS: , He is currently on several medications, a list of which is attached to the chart, and was reviewed.

It does not protrude beyond the end of the nail plate.  There is no active bleeding.  There is no edema or erythema of the digit tip.  Flexion and extension of the DIP joint is intact.  The remainder of the hand is unremarkable.,TREATMENT: , I did attempt to grasp the end of the splinter with splinter forceps, but it is brittle and continues to break off.  In order to better grasp the splinter, will require penetration beneath the nail plate, which the patient cannot tolerate due to pain.  Consequently, the base of the digit tip was prepped with Betadine, and just distal to the DIP joint, a digital block was applied with 1% lidocaine with complete analgesia of the digit tip.  I was able to grasp the splinter and remove this.  No further foreign body was seen beneath the nail plate and the area was cleansed and dressed with bacitracin and bandage.,ASSESSMENT: , Foreign body of the left fifth fingernail (wooden splinter).,PLAN: , Patient was urged to clean the area b.i.d. with soap and water and to dress with bacitracin and a Band-Aid.  If he notes increasing redness, pain, or swelling, he was urged to return for re-evaluation.consult - history and phy., horse serum, wooden splinter, foreign body, nail plate, grasp, fingernail, splinter,"

3,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 71-year-old female, who was referred for an outpatient modified barium swallow study to objectively evaluate her swallowing function and safety.  The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills.  She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals.  The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time.  The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.,STUDY:,  Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair.  To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).  The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.,ORAL STAGE:  ,The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport.  No spillage out lips.  The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars.  The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state.  Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation.  We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE:  ,No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.  She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  ,The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars.  Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.,PLAN:  ,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids.  She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.,2.  The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.,The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.,Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care.  She is not in need of skilled speech therapy and is discharged from my services.gastroenterology, globus sensation, oral stage, pharyngeal stage, cervical esophageal stage, consistency, otolaryngologist, barium swallow study evaluation, faucial pillars, swallow study, solid foods, evaluation, liquid, barium, oral, swallow, foods,"

He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patient’s overall clinical picture suggested that he had a,significant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular; his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further management on an outpatient basis.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA:,  The patient’s admission laboratory data was notable for his initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103.

3,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x4.,GRAFTS PERFORMED: , LIMA to LAD, left radial artery from the aorta to the PDA, left saphenous vein graft from the aorta sequential to the diagonal to the obtuse marginal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman, who presented with six-month history of progressively worsening exertional angina.  He had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved LV function.  He was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries.,FINDINGS DURING THE PROCEDURE:  ,The aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  Radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  All distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  The smallest target was the PDA, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  All the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  He was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, Precedex drips.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.,After prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  Left internal mammary artery was taken down.  Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.,Heparin was given.  Pericardium was opened and suspended.  During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.  Only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery.,Pericardium was opened and suspended.  Pursestring sutures were placed.  Aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.  With satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia.  An initial dose of about 1500 mL was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart.,PDA was exposed first.  The right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation.  Even in the PDA, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion.  Arteriotomy on the PDA was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions.  End radial to side PDA anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  This graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and LIMA was accommodated in the slit on its way to the LAD.  LAD was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end LIMA to side LAD anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  LIMA was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle.,Two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch.  Two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 Prolene.  The patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed.  Following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity.  Temporary V-pacing wires were placed.  Blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum.  Left chest Blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed.  After an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary V-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  With satisfactory hemodynamics, good LV function on TEE and baseline EKG, heparin was reversed using protamine.  Decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation.  Hemostasis was assured.  Mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy Vicryl for musculofascial closure, and Monocryl for subcuticular skin closure.  Dressings were applied.  The patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  He tolerated the procedure well.  All counts were correct at the termination of the procedure.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes.  Bypass time was 120 minutes.  The patient was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, and Precedex drips.cardiovascular / pulmonary, radial artery, lima, pda, obtuse marginal, exertional angina, coronary artery disease, triple-vessel, graft, conduit, ij triple-lumen catheter, cordis catheter, a-line, foley catheter, tee probes, coronary artery bypass grafting, cross clamp, mammary artery, saphenous vein, coronary artery, artery, cabg, coronary, grafting, aorta, angina, bypass"

Distal metaphyseal osteotomy and bunionectomy with internal screw fixation, right foot.,2.  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx, right foot.,ANESTHESIA:,Local infiltrate with IV sedation.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems.  The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options.,The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail.  The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE #1: , Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head.  The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound.,Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition.  The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition.  An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration.  Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove.  The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp.,Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment.  The access guide was noted to be in good position.  A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed.  The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal.  The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head.  The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal.,Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment.  It was then fixated with 1 screw.  A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction.  The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position.  Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory.  Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site.  Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally.  All rough edges were rasped smooth.  Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux.  A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated., ,PROCEDURE #2:,  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux.  The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint.  All vital structures were identified and retracted.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface.  The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux.  Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected.  The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.,Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site.  The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved.  The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips.,Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time.,A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient should wear it when walking or standing., ,The next office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions.  The patient was discharged home with vital signs stable in no acute distress. "

He was referred for stereotactic radiosurgery.  The risks of the radiosurgical treatment were discussed with the patient including, but not limited to, failure to completely obliterate the AVM, need for additional therapy, radiation injury, radiation necrosis, headaches, seizures, visual loss, or other neurologic deficits.  The patient understands these risks and would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient arrived to Outpatient CyberKnife Suite one day prior to the treatment.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was constructed.  Initial imaging was obtained by the CyberKnife system.  The patient was then transported over to the CT scanner at Stanford.  Under the supervision of Dr. X, 125 mL of Omnipaque 250 contrast was administered.  Dr. X then supervised the acquisition of 1.2-mm contiguous axial CT slices.  These images were uploaded over the hospital network to the treatment planning computer, and the patient was discharged home.,Treatment plan was then performed by me.  I outlined the tumor volume.  Inverse treatment planning was used to generate the treatment plan for this patient.  This resulted in a total dose of 20 Gy delivered to 84% isodose line using a 12.5 mm collimator.  The maximum dose within this center of treatment volume was 23.81 Gy.  The volume treated was 2.972 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 1.9 x 2.7 x 1.6 cm.  The volume treated at the reference dose was 98%.  The coverage isodose line was 79%.  The conformality index was 1.74 and modified conformality index was 1.55.  The treatment plan was reviewed by me and Dr. Y of Radiation Oncology, and the treatment plan was approved.,On the morning of May 14, 2004, the patient arrived at the Outpatient CyberKnife Suite.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was applied.  Initial imaging was used to bring the patient into optimal position.  The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to deliver the 20 Gy to the AVM margin.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was given 8 mg of Decadron for prophylaxis and discharged home.,Followup will consist of an MRI scan in 6 months.  The patient will return to our clinic once that study is completed.,I was present and participated in the entire procedure on this patient consisting of CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital AVM.,Dr. X was present during the entire procedure and will be dictating his own operative note.neurosurgery, ct-guided, occipital, cyberknife, frameless stereotactic radiosurgery, occipital arteriovenous malformation, conformality index, arteriovenous malformation, malformation, avm, arteriovenous,"

Streptococcal pneumonia with sepsis.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Unobtainable as the patient is intubated for respiratory failure.,CURRENT HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 20-year-old female who presented with symptoms of pneumonia and developed rapid sepsis and respiratory failure requiring intubation.  At this time, she is being treated aggressively with mechanical ventilation and other supportive measures and has developed disseminated intravascular coagulation with prolonged partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer.  At this time, I am being consulted for further evaluation and recommendations for treatment.  The nurses report that she has actually improved clinically over the last 24 hours.  Bleeding has been a problem; however, it seems to have been abrogated at this time with factor replacement as well as platelet infusion.  There is no prior history of coagulopathy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Otherwise nondescript as is the past surgical history.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,There were possible illicit drugs.

There are no petechiae.  Her nasal vestibules are clear.  Oropharynx has ET tube in place.,NECK:  No jugular venous pressure distention.,CHEST:  Coarse breath sounds bilaterally.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with good bowel sounds.  There was some oozing around the site of her central line.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  There is no evidence of compromise arterial blood flow at the digits or of her hands or feet.,LABORATORY STUDIES:  ,The DIC parameters with a platelet count of approximately 50,000, INR of 2.4, normal PTT at this time, fibrinogen of 200, and a D-dimer of 13.,IMPRESSION/PLAN:  ,At this time is disseminated intravascular coagulation from sepsis from pneumococcal disease.  My recommendation for the patient is to continue factor replacement as you are.  It seems that her clinical course is reversing and simple factor replacement is probably is the best measure at this time.  There is no indication at this point for Xigris.  However, if her coagulopathy does not resolve within the next 24 hours and continue to improve with an elevated fibrinogen, normalization of her coagulation times, I would consider low-dose continuous infusion heparin for abrogation of consumption of coagulation routines and continued supportive infusions.  I will repeat her laboratory studies in the morning and give more recommendations at that time.hematology - oncology, intravascular, coagulation, pneumonia, thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, streptococcal pneumonia, intravascular coagulation, infusion, coagulopathy, fibrinogen, respiratory, oropharynx, sepsis, disseminated, "

She was scheduled for elective excision with frozen section under local anesthesia as an outpatient.,PROCEDURE: , With an intravenous infusing and under suitable premedication, the patient was placed supine on the operative table.  The face was prepped with pHisoHex draped.  The right medial canthal region and the glabellar region were anesthetized with 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.,Under loupe magnification, the lesion was excised with 2 mm margins, oriented with sutures and submitted for frozen section pathology.  The report was ""basal cell carcinoma with all margins free of tumor.""  Hemostasis was controlled with the Bovie.  Excised lesion diameter was 1.2 cm.  The defect was closed by elevating a left laterally based rotation flap utilizing the glabellar skin.  The flap was elevated with a scalpel and Bovie, rotated into the defect without tension, ***** to the defect with scissors and inset in layer with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl for the dermis and running 5-0 Prolene for the skin.  Donor site was closed in V-Y fashion with similar suture technique.,The wounds were dressed with bacitracin ointment.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

Partial plantar fasciotomy.,3.  Posterior subtalar and tibiotalar capsulotomy.,4.  Short leg cast placed.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 69 minutes.,The patient in local anesthetic of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine plain.,COMPLICATIONS: , No intraoperative complications.,DRAINS:  ,None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: , The patient is a 13-year-old female who had previous bilateral feet correction at 1 year of age.  Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain.  Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot.  Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  The patient had a previous incision along the calcaneocuboid lateral part of the foot.  This was marked and extended proximally through the Achilles tendon.  Extremity was wrapped in Esmarch.  Tourniquet inflation was noted to be 250 mmHg.  Decision was then made to protect the sural nerve.  There was one sensory nervous branch that did cross the field though it was subsequently sharply ligated because it was in the way.  Dissection was carried down to Achilles tendon, which was subsequently de-lengthened with the distal half performed down the lateral thigh.  Proximal end was tacked with an 0 Ethibond suture and subsequently repaired end-on-end at length with the heel in neutral.  Dissection was then carried on the lateral border of the foot with identification of the peroneal longus and valgus tendons, which were removed from the sheath and retracted dorsally.  At this time, we also noted that calcaneocuboid joint appeared to be fused.  The area between the anterior and middle facets were plicated on fluoroscopy for planned osteotomy.  This was performed with a saw.  After a partial plantar fasciotomy was performed, this was released off an abductor digiti minimi.  The osteotomy was completed with an osteotome and distracted with the lamina spreader.  A tricortical allograft was then shaped and subsequently impacted into this area.  Final positioning was checked with multiple views of fluoroscopy.  It was subsequently fixed using a 0.94 K-wire and drilled from the heel anteriorly.  A pin was subsequently bent and cut short at the level of the skin.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline.  The Achilles was repaired with this tie.  Please note during the case, it was noted the patient had continued significant stiffness despite the Achilles lengthening.  A posterior capsulotomy of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints were performed with increased 10 degrees of dorsiflexion.  Wound was then closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl.  The surgical field was irrigated with 0.25% Marcaine and subsequently injected with more Marcaine at the end of the case.  The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  Skin was dressed with Xeroform and 4 x 4's.  Everything was wrapped with 4 x 4's in sterile Webril.  The tourniquet was released after 69 minutes.  A short-leg cast was then placed with good return of capillary refill to his toes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized overnight for elevation, ice packs, neurovascular checks, and pain control.  The patient to be strict nonweightbearing.  We will arrange for her to get a wheelchair.  The patient will then follow up in about 10 to 14 days for a cast check, as well as pain control.  The patient will need an AFO script at that time.

4,"DIAGNOSES:,1.  Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.,2.  Recent generalized tonic-clonic seizure.,MEDICATIONS:,1.  Lamictal 250 mg b.i.d.,2.  Depo-Provera.,INTERIM HISTORY: , The patient returns for followup.  Since last consultation she has tolerated Lamictal well, but she has had a recurrence of her myoclonic jerking.  She has not had a generalized seizure.  She is very concerned that this will occur.  Most of the myoclonus is in the mornings.  Recent EEG did show polyspike and slow wave complexes bilaterally, more prominent on the left.  She states that she has been very compliant with the medications and is getting a good amount of sleep.  She continues to drive.,Social history and review of systems are discussed above and documented on the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Vital signs are normal.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  There is no nystagmus.  Visual fields are full.  Demeanor is normal.  Facial sensation and symmetry is normal.  No myoclonic jerks noted during this examination.  No myoclonic jerks provoked by tapping on her upper extremity muscles.  Negative orbit.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and symmetric.  Gait is normal.  Tandem gait is normal.  Romberg negative.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  Recurrence of early morning myoclonus despite high levels of Lamictal.  She is tolerating the medication well and has not had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  She is concerned that this is a precursor for another generalized seizure.  She states that she is compliant with her medications and has had a normal sleep-wake cycle.,Looking back through her notes, she initially responded very well to Keppra, but did have a breakthrough seizure on Keppra.  This was thought secondary to severe insomnia when her baby was very young.  Because she tolerated the medication well and it was at least partially affective, I have recommended adding Keppra 500 mg b.i.d.  Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.,I will see in followup in three months.neurology, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, tonic clonic seizure, myoclonic epilepsy, tonic clonic, juvenile, myoclonus, epilepsy, myoclonic, seizure"

A viable male neonate with Apgars of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively.  Infant weight equaled to 4140 gm with clear amniotic fluid.  The umbilical cord was wrapped around the leg tightly x1.  Infant was in a vertex, right occiput anterior position.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 19-year-old G1 P0 at 41 and 1/7th weeks' intrauterine pregnancy.  She presented at mid night on 08/22/03 complaining of spontaneous rupture of membranes, which was confirmed in Labor and Delivery.  The patient had a positive group beta strep colonization culture and was started on penicillin.  The patient was also started on Pitocin protocol at that time.  The patient was monitored throughout the morning showing some irregular contractions every 5 to 6 minutes and then eventually no contractions on the monitor.  IUPC was placed without difficulty and contractions appeared to be regular, however, they were inadequate amount of the daily units.  The patient was given a rest from the Pitocin.  She walked and had a short shower.  The patient was then placed back on Pitocin with IUPC in place and we were unable to achieve adequate contractions.  Maximum cervical dilation was 5 cm, 80% effaced, negative 2 station, and cephalic position.  At the time of C-section, the patient had been ruptured for over 24 hours and it was determined that she would not progress in her cervical dilation, as there was suspected macrosomia on ultrasound.  Options were discussed with the patient and family and it was determined that we will take her for C-section today.  Consent was signed.  All questions were answered with Dr. X present.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where a spinal anesthetic was placed.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with left upward tilt.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion and her spinal anesthetic was found to adequate.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made with a first scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second scalpel.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using curved Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Ochsner and Kocher clamps and elevated off the rectus muscles.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision where Kocher clamps were used to elevate the fascia off the underlying rectus muscle.  The rectus muscle was separated in the midline bluntly.  The underlying peritoneum was tented up with Allis clamps and incised using Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then bluntly stretched.  The bladder blade was placed.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, tented up with Allis' and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted in the lower uterine segment.  A low transverse uterine incision was made with a second scalpel.  The uterine incision was extended laterally bluntly.  The bladder blade was removed and the infant's head was delivered with the assistance of a vacuum.  Infant's nose and mouth were bulb suctioned and the body was delivered atraumatically.  There was, of note, an umbilical cord around the leg tightly x1.,Cord was clamped and cut.  Infant was handed to the waiting pediatrician.  Cord gas was sent for pH as well as blood typing.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was grasped circumferentially with Alfred clamps and closed with #0-Chromic in a running locked fashion.  A second layer of imbricating stitch was performed using #0-Chromic suture to obtain excellent hemostasis.  The uterus was returned to the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The rectus muscle was loosely approximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a single interrupted fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous Scarpa's fascia was then closed with #2-0 plain gut.  The skin was then closed with staples.  The incision was dressed with sterile dressing and bandage.  Blood clots were evacuated from the vagina.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.

Hemodynamic monitoring was begun.  Time-out was called and the patient eye operated upon and lens implant intended were verbally verified.  Three drops of tetracaine were applied to the operative eye.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for intraocular surgery.  A lid speculum was placed.  Two paracentesis sites were created approximately 120 degrees apart straddling the temple using a slit knife.  The anterior chamber was irrigated with a dilute 0.25% solution of non-preserved lidocaine and filled with Viscoat.  The clear corneal temporal incision was fashioned.  The anterior chamber was entered by introducing a keratome.  The continuous tear capsulorrhexis was performed using the bent needle cystotome and completed with Utrata forceps.  The cataractous lens was then hydrodissected and phacoemulsified using a modified phaco-chop technique.  Following removal of the last nuclear quadrant, there was noted to be a posterior capsular hole nasally.  This area was tamponaded with Healon.  The anterior chamber was swept with a cyclodialysis spatula and there was noted to be vitreous prolapse.  An anterior vitrectomy was then performed bimanually until the vitreous was cleared from the anterior chamber area.  The sulcus area of the lens was then inflated using Healon and a V9002 16.0 diopter intraocular lens was unfolded and centered in the sulcus area with haptic secured in the sulcus.  There was noted to be good support.  Miostat was injected into the anterior chamber and viscoelastic agent rinsed out of the eye with Miostat.  Gentle bimanual irrigation, aspiration was performed to remove remaining viscoelastic agents anteriorly.  The pupil was noted to constrict symmetrically.  Wounds were checked with Weck-cels and found to be free of vitreous.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to normal depth as confirmed by tactile pressure at about 12.  All corneal wounds were then hydrated, checked and found to be watertight and free of vitreous.  A single 10-0 nylon suture was placed temporarily as prophylaxis and the knot buried.  Lid speculum was removed.  TobraDex ointment, light patch and a Soft Shield were applied.  The patient was taken to the recovery room, awake and comfortable.  We will follow up in the morning for postoperative check.  He will not be given Diamox due to his sulfa allergy.

She requested appendectomy because of the concern of future diagnostic dilemma with pain crisis.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy were recommended to her.  The procedure was explained in detail including the risks of bleeding, infection, biliary injury, retained common duct stones.  After answering her questions, she wished to proceed and gave informed consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table.  She was positively identified and the correct surgical site and procedure reviewed.  After successful administration of general endotracheal anesthesia, the skin of the abdomen was prepped with chlorhexidine solution and sterilely draped.,The infraumbilical skin was infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and horizontal incision created.  The linea alba was grasped with a hemostat and Veress needle was placed into the peritoneal cavity and used to insufflate carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm expandable disposable trocar was placed and through this a 30 degree laparoscope was used to inspect the peritoneal cavity.  Upper abdominal anatomy was normal.  Pelvic laparoscopy revealed bilaterally closed internal inguinal rings.  Additional trocars were placed under direct vision including a 5-mm reusable in the right lateral _____.  There was a 12-mm expandable disposable in the right upper quadrant and a 5-mm reusable in the subxiphoid region.  Using these, the gallbladder was grasped and retraced cephalad.  Adhesions were taken down over the cystic duct and the duct was circumferentially dissected and clipped at the gallbladder cystic duct junction.  A small ductotomy was created.  Reddick cholangiogram catheter was then placed within the duct and the balloon inflated.  Continuous fluoroscopy was used to instill contrast material.  This showed normal common bile duct which entered the duodenum without obstruction.  There was no evidence of common bile duct stones.  The cholangiogram catheter was removed.  The duct was doubly clipped and divided.  The artery was divided and cauterized.  The gallbladder was taken out of the gallbladder fossa.  It was then placed in Endocatch bag and left in the abdomen.  Attention was then paid to the appendix.  The appendix was identified and window was made in the mesoappendix at the base.  This was amputated with an Endo-GIA stapler.  The mesoappendix was divided with an Endo-GIA vascular stapler.  This was placed in another Endocatch bag.  The abdomen was then irrigated.  Hemostasis was satisfactory.  Both the appendix and gallbladder were removed and sent for pathology.  All trocars were removed.  The 12-mm port sites were closed with 2-0 PDS figure-of-eight fascial sutures.  The umbilical skin was reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl Rapide.  The remaining skin incisions were closed with 5-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.  The skin was cleaned.  Mastisol, Steri-Strips and band-aids were applied.

Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 utilizing left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, and reverse autogenous saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery.  Total cardiopulmonary bypass,cold blood potassium cardioplegia, antegrade and retrograde, for myocardial protection, placement of temporary pacing wires.,DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room, placed in supine position.  Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring lines were placed.  The chest, abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The greater saphenous vein was harvested from the right upper leg through interrupted skin incisions and was prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 silk and flushing with vein solution.  The leg was closed with running 3-0 Dexon subcu, and running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular on the skin, and later wrapped.  A median sternotomy incision was made and the left internal mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff at the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The sternum was closed.  A right carotid incision was made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and carried down to and through the platysma.  The deep fascia was divided.  The facial vein was divided between clamps and tied with 2-0 silk.  The common carotid artery, takeoff of the external and internal carotid arteries were dissected free, with care taken to identify and preserve the hypoglossal and vagus nerves.  The common carotid artery was double-looped with umbilical tape, takeoff of the external was looped with a heavy silk, distal internal was double-looped with a heavy silk.  Shunts were prepared.  A patch was prepared.  Heparin 50 mg was given IV.  Clamp was placed on the beginning of the takeoff of the external and the proximal common carotid artery.  Distal internal was held with a forceps.  Internal carotid artery was opened with 11-blade.  Potts scissors were then used to extend the aortotomy through the lesion into good internal carotid artery beyond.  The shunt was placed and proximal and distal snares were tightened.  Endarterectomy was carried out under direct vision in the common carotid artery and the internal reaching a fine, feathery distal edge using eversion on the external.  All loose debris was removed and Dacron patch was then sutured in place with running 6-0 Prolene suture, removing the shunt just prior to completing the suture line.  Suture line was completed and the neck was packed.,The pericardium was opened.  A pericardial cradle was created.  The patient was heparinized for cardiopulmonary bypass, cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula.  A retrograde cardioplegia cannula was placed with a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene into the coronary sinus, and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  An antegrade cardioplegia needle sump was placed in the ascending aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  The ascending aorta was cross-clamped and cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given antegrade, a total of 5 cc per kg.  This was followed sumping of the ascending aorta and retrograde cardioplegia, a total of 5 cc per kg to the coronary sinus.  The obtuse marginal 1 coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The vein was cut to length.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.  The obtuse marginal 2 was not felt to be suitable for bypass, therefore, the posterior descending of the right coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture to reverse autogenous saphenous vein.  The vein was cut to length.  The mammary was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.  The anterior descending was identified and opened. the mammary was then sutured to this with running 8-0 Prolene suture.  Warm blood potassium cardioplegia was given, and the cross-clamp was removed.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  Two aortotomies were made.  The veins were cut to fit these and sutured in place with running 5-0 Prolene suture.  The partial- occlusion clamp was removed.  All anastomoses were inspected and noted to be patent and dry.  Atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed.  Ventilation was commenced.  The patient was fully warmed.  The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and de-cannulated in a routine fashion.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.

Discussed risks, complications, and consequences of a surgical biopsy of the left true vocal cord and consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to operative suite by anesthesia, placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the operative table was turned 90 degrees by the Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed followed by the patient being placed in reverse Trendelenburg.,After this, a mouthguard was placed in the upper teeth and a Dedo laryngoscope was placed in the patient's oral cavity and advanced through the oral cavity in the oropharynx down into the hypopharynx.  The patient's larynx was then brought into view with the true vocal cords hidden underneath what appeared to be redundant false vocal cords.  The left true vocal cord was then first addressed and appeared to have an extensive area of leukoplakia extending from the posterior one-third up to the anterior third.  The false vocal cord also appeared to be very full on the left side along with fullness in the subglottic region.  The patient's anterior commissure appeared to be clear.  The false cord on the right side also appeared to be very redundant and overshadowing the true vocal cord.  Once the true vocal cord was retracted laterally, there was revealed a second area of leukoplakia involving the right true vocal cord in the anterior one-third aspect.  The patient's subglottic region was very edematous and with redundant mucosal tissue.  The areas of leukoplakia appeared to be cobblestoned in appearance, irregularly bordered, and very hard to the touch.  The left true vocal cord was then first addressed, was stripped from posteriorly to anteriorly utilizing a #45 laryngeal forceps.  After this, the patient had pressure placed upon this area with tropical adrenaline and a rectal swab to maintain hemostasis.  The specimen was passed off the field and was sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Hemostasis was maintained on the left side.  Prior to taking this biopsy, the Louie arm was attached to the laryngoscope and then suspended on the Mayo stand.  The Zeiss operating microscope was then brought into view to directly visualize the vocal cords.  The biopsies were taken under direct visualization utilizing the Zeiss operating microscope.  After the specimen was taken and the laryngoscope was desuspended from the Mayo stand and Louie arm was removed, the scope was then pulled more cephalad and the piriform sinuses, valecula, and base of the tongue were all directly visualized, which appeared normal except for the left base of tongue appeared to be full.  This area was biopsied multiple times with a straight laryngeal forceps and passed off the field and sent to Pathology as specimen.  The scope was then pulled back into the superior aspect of hypopharynx into the oropharynx and the oral cavity demonstrated no signs of any gross lesions.  A bimanual examination was then performed, which again demonstrated a fullness on the left base of tongue region with no signs of any other gross lesions.  There were no signs of any palpable cervical lymphadenopathy.  The tooth guard was removed and the patient was then turned back to anesthesia.  The patient did receive intraoperatively 10 mg of Decadron.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room.,The patient was transferred to recovery room in stable condition and tolerated the procedure well.  The patient will be sent home with prescriptions for Medrol DOSEPAK, Tylenol with Codeine, Elixir, and amoxicillin 250 mg per 5 cc.surgery, direct laryngoscopy, zeiss operating microscope, vocal cord lesions, vocal cord, cord, vocal, microscopic, laryngoscopy, hoarseness, biopsy, leukoplakia"
4,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.

4,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Ruptured distal biceps tendon, right elbow.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Ruptured distal biceps tendon, right elbow.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Repair of distal biceps tendon, right elbow.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR, Room #2 and administered a general anesthetic.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A sterile tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity.  The extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  Tourniquet time was 74 minutes.  A curvilinear incision was made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Subcutaneous fat was separated and the skin flaps elevated.  The _________ was identified.  It was incised.  The finger was placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon was found.  There was some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture.  This area was suctioned clean.  The biceps tendon ends were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface.  At this point, the #2 fiber wire was then passed through the tendon.  Two fiber wires were utilized in a Krackow-type suture.  Once this was completed, dissection was taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously.  The radial tuberosity was palpated.  Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and was used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow.  A skin incision was made over this area.  Approximately two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split.,A stat was then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa.  The tails of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision.  At this point, they were placed to the side.  Attention was directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated.  The tuberosity came into view.  The margins were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection.  Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high was placed in the radial tuberosity.  Three small drill holes were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture.  The area was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  A #4-0 pullout wire was utilized to pass the sutures through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole.  The elbow was flexed and the tendon was then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated.  The suture was tied over the bone islands.  Both wounds were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Muscle fascia was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture on the lateral incision followed by closure of the skin with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and small staples.  The anterior incision was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl for Subq. and then skin was approximated with small staples.  Both wounds were infiltrated with a total of 30 cc of 0.25% Marcaine solution for postop analgesia.  A bulky fluff dressing was applied to the elbow, followed by application of a long-arm plaster splint maintaining the forearm in the supinated position.  Tourniquet was inflated prior to application of the splint.  Circulatory status returned to the extremity immediately.  The patient was awakened.  He was rather boisterous during his awakening, but care was taken to protect the right upper extremity.  He was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.orthopedic, ruptured distal biceps tendon, gentamicin solution, antecubital fossa, distal biceps, biceps tendon, tendon, tuberosity, biceps, elbow,"
3,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Clogged AV shunt.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 32-year-old African-American male who came to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient complains of fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever.  The patient states that the shunt was placed in February, although according to medical records it was placed in April and it has been periodically clogging since its placement.  The patient had dialysis today, which is Saturday, for approximately one hour before the shunt no longer worked.  The patient had been seen in the Emergency Room yesterday, 08/29/03, by Dr. X for the same problem.  At that time, Dr. X felt that the patient should use the AV fistula during dialysis and after the fistula is able to be used, the PermCath on the right subclavian should be removed.  As mentioned above, he had dialysis today and they were unable to use AV fistula as well as the PermCath read ""did not work"".

Breathing spontaneously.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 38-year-old Caucasian male who was referred to clinic to evaluate a cyst in his left mandible.  Preoperatively, a biopsy of the cyst was obtained and it was noted to be a benign dentigerous cyst.,After evaluation of the location of the cyst and the impacted wisdom tooth approximately the inferior border of the mandible, it was determined that the patient would benefit from removal of the cyst and removal of tooth #17 under general anesthesia in the operating room.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room #1 at Hospital and laid in the supine fashion on the operating room table.  As stated, general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetics and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inhalation anesthetics.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual oro-maxillofacial surgery fashion.,Approximately, #6 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected in the usual nerve block fashion.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, a moistened Ray-Tec sponge was placed in the posterior pharynx.  Peridex mouth rinse was used to prep the oral cavity.  This was removed with suction.,Using a #15 blade a sagittal split osteotomy incision was made along the left ramus.  A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated and the crest of the bone was identified where the crown had super-erupted since the biopsy 6 weeks earlier.  Using a Hall drill, a buccal osteotomy was developed, the tooth was sectioned in half, fractured with an elevator and delivered in two pieces.  Using a double-ended curette, the remainder of the cystic lining was removed from the left mandible and sent to pathology with the tooth for review.,The area was irrigated with copious amounts of sterile water and closed with 3-0 chromic gut suture.

2,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today because of some problems with her right hand.  It has been going tingling and getting numb periodically over several weeks.  She just recently moved her keyboard down at work.  She is hoping that will help.  She is worried about carpal tunnel.  She does a lot of repetitive type activities.  It is worse at night.  If she sleeps on it a certain way, she will wake up and it will be tingling then she can usually shake out the tingling, but nonetheless it is very bothersome for her.  It involves mostly the middle finger, although, she says it also involves the first and second digits on the right hand.  She has some pain in her thumb as well.  She thinks that could be arthritis.,OBJECTIVE: , Weight 213.2 pounds, blood pressure 142/84, pulse 92, respirations 16.  General:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Musculoskeletal:  The right hand was examined.  It appears to be within normal limits and the appearance is similar to the left hand.  She has good and equal grip strength noted bilaterally.  She has negative Tinel's bilaterally.  She has a positive Phalen's test.  The fingers on the right hand are neurovascularly intact with a normal capillary refill.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Numbness and tingling in the right upper extremity, intermittent and related to the positioning of the wrist.  I suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.,PLAN:  ,The patient is going to use Anaprox double strength one pill every 12 hours with food as well as a cock-up wrist splint.  We are going to try this for two weeks and if the condition is still present, then we are going to proceed with EMG test at that time.  She is going to let me know.  While she is here, I am going to also get her the blood test she needs for her diabetes.  I am noting that her blood pressure is elevated, but improved from the last visit.  I also noticed that she has lost a lot of weight.  She is working on diet and exercise and she is doing a great job.  Right now for the blood pressure we are going to continue to observe as she carries forward additional measures in her diet and exercise to lose more weight and I expect the blood pressure will continue to improve.soap / chart / progress notes, tinel's, phalen's, positioning of the wrist, numbness and tingling, carpal tunnel syndrome, carpal tunnel, numbness, tingling"
3,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , We were asked to see the patient in regards to a brain tumor.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,She was initially diagnosed in September of this year with a glioblastoma multiforme.  She presented with several lesions in her brain and a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.  She was seen by Dr. X in our group.  Because of her living arrangement, she elected to have treatment through the hospital radiation department and oncology department.  Details of her treatment are not available at the time of this dictation.  Her family has a packet of Temodar 100-mg pills.  She is admitted now with increasing confusion.  A CT shows increase in size of the lesions compared to the preoperative scan.  We are asked to comment on her treatment at this point.  She herself is confused and is unable to provide further history.  ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , From her old chart:  No known past medical history prior to the diagnosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She was living alone and is now living in assisted living.  ,MEDICATIONS,1.

Left leg slightly weak.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  Glioblastoma multiforme, uncertain as to where she is in cancer treatment.  Given the number of pills in the patient's family's hands, it sounds like she has only been treated recently and therefore it is not surprising that she is showing increased problems related to increased size of the tumor.  We will have to talk with Dr. Y in the Clinic to get a better handle on her treatment regimen.  At this point, I will hold Temodar today and consider restarting it tomorrow if we can get her treatment plan clarified.nan"

The patient had stones x2, 1 was already removed, second one came down, had recurrent episode of sepsis, stent was placed.  Options were given such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, shockwave lithotripsy etc.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, need for stent, and removal of the stent were discussed.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A 0.035 glidewire was placed in the left system.  Using graspers, left-sided stent was removed.  A semirigid ureteroscopy was done.  A stone was visualized in the mid to upper ureter.  Using laser, the stone was broken into 5 to 6 small pieces.  Using basket extraction, all the pieces were removed.  Ureteroscopy all the way up to the UPJ was done, which was negative.  There were no further stones.  Using pyelograms, the rest of the system appeared normal.  The entire ureter on the left side was open and patent.  There were no further stones.  Due to the edema and the surgery, plan was to leave the stent attached to the string and the patient was to pull the string in about 24 hours.  Over the 0.035 glidewire, a 26 double-J stent was placed.  There was a nice curl in the kidney and one in the bladder.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Please note that the string was kept in place and the patient was to remove the stent the next day.  The patient's family was instructed how to do so.  The patient had antibiotics and pain medications at home.  The patient was brought to recovery room in a stable condition.surgery, laser lithotripsy, shockwave lithotripsy, double-j stent, distal ureteral stone, ureteral stone, basket extraction, cystopyelogram, laser, lithotripsy, stones, string, ureteroscopy, stone, stent,"

4,"CC:, Horizontal diplopia.,HX: , This 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline.

There are patchy areas of low density in the periventricular white matter consistent with age related changes from microvascular disease. The midbrain findings are most suggestive of a hemangioma, though another consideration would be a low grade astrocytoma (this would likely show less enhancement). Metastatic lesions could show calcification but one would expect to see some degree of edema. The long standing clinical history suggest the former (i.e. hemangioma).,No surgical or neuroradiologic intervention was done and the patient was simply followed.

The patient had a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy performed in the office which demonstrated the mass and confirmed also on CT scan.  The patient also has had this right upper lid skin lesion which appears to be a cholesterol granuloma for numerous months.  It appears to be growing in size and is irregularly bordered.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed to the patient, a written consent was obtained for the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was turned to 90 degrees by the Department of Anesthesia.  The right upper eyelid skin lesion was injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 1 cc total.  After this, the patient's bilateral nasal passages were then packed with cocaine-soaked cottonoids of 10% solution of 4 cc total.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and the right upper lid skin was then first cut around the skin lesion utilizing a Superblade.  After this, the skin lesion was then grasped with a ________ in the  superior aspect and the skin lesion was cut and removed in the subcutaneous plane utilizing Westcott scissors.  After this, the ________ was then hemostatically controlled with monopolar cauterization.  The patient's skin was then reapproximated with a running #6-0 Prolene suture.  A Mastisol along with a single Steri-Strip was in place followed Maxitrol ointment.  Attention then was drawn to the nasopharynx.  The cocaine-soaked cottonoids were removed from the nasal passages bilaterally and zero-degree otoscope was placed all the way to the patient's nasopharynx.  The patient had a severely deviated nasal septum more so to the right than the left.  There appeared to be a spur on the left inferior aspect and also on the right posterior aspect.  The nasopharyngeal mass appeared polypoid in nature almost lymphoid tissue looking.  It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 of approximately 3 cc total.  After this, the lesion was then removed on the right side with the XPS blade.  The torus tubarius was noted on the left side with the polypoid lymphoid tissue involving this area completely.  This area was taken down with the XPS blade.  Prior to taking down this lesion with the XPS, multiple biopsies were taken with a straight biter.  After this, a cocaine-soaked cottonoid was placed back in the patient's left nasal passage region and the nasopharynx and the attention was then drawn to the right side.  The zero-degree otoscope was placed in the patient's right nasal passage and all the way to the nasopharynx.  Again, the XPS was then utilized to take down the nasopharyngeal mass in its entirety with some involvement overlying the torus tubarius.  After this, the patient was then hemostatically controlled with suctioned Bovie cauterization.  A FloSeal was then placed followed by bilateral Merocels and bacitracin-coated ointment.  The patient's Meroceles were then tied together to the patient's forehead and the patient was then turned back to the Anesthesia.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent home and with instructions to followup approximately in one week.

The neck was placed in a flexed position.  The patient was monitored with blood pressure cuff, EKG, and pulse oximetry and given oxygen via nasal cannula.  The patient was lightly sedated.  The skin was prepped and draped in a sterile classical fashion.,Under fluoroscopy control, the waists of the articular pillars were identified and marked.  Local anesthesia infiltrated subcutaneously and deep extending down toward these previously marked points.  Once the anesthesia was established, an insulated 10-cm, 22-gauge needle with a 5-mm non-insulated stimulating tip was placed in contact with the waists of the articular pillars at the affected levels that were previously mentioned.  This was done under direct fluoroscopic control utilizing a gun barrel technique with PA views initially for orientation and then a lateral view to determine the depth of the needle.  For C3 to C6 medial branch RFTC's, the needles are placed along the ventral aspect of a line that connects the greatest antero-posterior diameter of the articular pillar but remains dorsal to the foramen as seen on lateral imaging.  For a C7 medial branch RFTC, the needle tip is positioned more superiorly such that it overlies the superior articular process.  For a C8 medial branch RFTC, the needle is placed at the junction of the superior articulating facet and the base of the transverse process of T1.,Sensory stimulation was carried out at 50 Hz from 0 to 2.0 volts.  Stimulation was stopped once the maximum voltage was delivered or the patient either described a buzzing sensation indicating that it was a nonpainful nerve, or it caused replication of their concordant pain.  The stimulation was then changed to 2 Hz for motor stimulation and advanced up to 2.0 volts or until motor stimulation was found at that level.  If motor stimulation occurred, the needle was repositioned to abolish it but still cause concordant pain, or the RFTC was aborted at this level.,If the sensory stimulation caused concordant pain without motor stimulation, the area was then anesthetized with 1 cc of Marcaine 0.5% with 5 mg of methyl prednisolone acetate.  Once the anesthesia was established, a radiofrequency lesioning was then done at 65 degrees for 60 seconds.  The same procedure was carried out at all the affected levels.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any difficulties or complications.pain management, rami, fluoroscopic control, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, cervical spondylosis, articular pillars, motor stimulation, medial branch, thermocoagulation, rftc, needle, cervical, stimulation"

Complex renal cyst versus renal cell carcinoma or other tumor.,4. Osteoarthritis.,HOSPITAL COURSE:, This is a 77-year-old African-American male who was previously well until he began having gross hematuria and clots passing through his urethra on the day of admission. He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he does have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 years ago. He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended.,He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulties in his activities of daily living, and his Foley was removed on the day of discharge.,He was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course. He is asked to continue the Colace as an outpatient for stool softening for comfort.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:, Colace 100 mg 1 b.i.d.,DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP PLANNING:, The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician at ABCD, Dr. B or Dr. J, the patient is unsure of which, in the next couple weeks. He is to follow up with Dr. G of  Urology in the next week by phone in regards to the patient's MRI and plans for a laparoscopic partial renal resection biopsy. This is scheduled for the week after discharge potentially by Dr. G, and the patient will discuss the exact time later this week.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right mesothelioma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lung mass invading diaphragm and liver.,FINDINGS: , Right lower lobe lung mass invading diaphragm and liver.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Right thoracotomy.,2.  Right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and portion of liver.,SPECIMENS: , Right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and portion of liver.,BLOOD LOSS: , 600 mL.,FLUIDS: , Crystalloid 2.7 L and 1 unit packed red blood cells.,ANESTHESIA: , Double-lumen endotracheal tube.,CONDITION:,  Stable, extubated, to PACU.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  Briefly, this is a gentleman who was diagnosed with a B-cell lymphoma and then subsequently on workup noted to have a right-sided mass seeming to arise from the right diaphragm.  He was presented at Tumor Board where it was thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma.  Thus, he was offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure.  He wished to proceed, so he was brought to the operating room.,An epidural catheter was placed.  He was put in a supine position where SCDs and Foley catheter were placed.  He was put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  He was given preoperative antibiotics, then he was placed in the left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace was made using the skin knife and then Bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the Alexander instrument, the chest was entered.  Upon entering the chest, the chest wall retractor was inserted and the cavity inspected.  It appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and was involving the diaphragm.  He also had some marked lymphadenopathy.  With these findings, which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma, we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection.  Thus, we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly.  We also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the arteries going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar arteries as well as the artery going to the right middle lobe.  The posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a GIA stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 2-0 ties.  Once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy, we were able to pass a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment.  This was ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 3-0 silk.  This was divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe.  This was also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated.  Care was taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobe.,We then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein.  The superior pulmonary vein was visualized as well.  The right angle was passed around the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was ligated in continuity with 2-0 silk and a 3-0 stick tie.  Upon division of this portion, the specimen site had some bleeding, which was eventually controlled using several 3-0 silk sutures.  The bronchial anatomy was defined.  Next, we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe as well as the right middle lobe.  A TA-30 4.8 stapler was then closed.  The lung insufflated.  The right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well.  The stapler was fired, and the bronchus was cut with a 10-blade.,We then turned our attention to the diaphragm.  There was a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm has involved with tumor, and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin.  Upon going through the diaphragm, it became clear that the tumor was also involving the dome of the liver, so after going around the diaphragm in its entirety, we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that was involved.  It seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion.  The Bovie was set to high cautery.  The capsule was entered, and then using Bovie cautery, we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver.  It did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver.  Hemostasis was achieved with Bovie cautery and gentle pressure.  The specimen was then taken off the table and sent to Pathology for permanent.  The area was inspected for hemostasis.  A 10-flat JP was placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection, and 0 Prolene was used to close the diaphragmatic defect, which was under very little tension.  A single 32 straight chest tube was also placed.  The lung was seen to expand.  We also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobes would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe.  Hemostasis was observed at the end of the case.  The chest tube was irrigated with sterile water, and there was no air leak observed from the bronchial stump.  The chest was then closed with Vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscles, staying above the ribs.  The 2-0 Vicryl was used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer, and 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin.  The patient was then brought to supine position, extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.,Dr. X was present for the entirety of the procedure, which was a right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and a portion of liver.surgery, double lumen endotracheal, en bloc resection, malignant mesothelioma, lung mass, endotracheal tube, chest tube, bovie cautery, en bloc, diaphragm, lobectomy, mesothelioma, thoracotomy, "

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed directly over the first left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the left great toe.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular attachments were mobilized from the head of the first left metatarsal.  The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the left great toe and transversally resected from its insertion.  A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  The dorsomedial prominence of the first left metatarsal head was adequately exposed using sharp dissection and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  The same saw was used to perform an Austin-type bunionectomy on the capital aspect of the first left metatarsal head with its apex distal and its base proximal on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The capital fragment of the first left metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  Provisional fixation was achieved with two smooth wires that were inserted vertically to the dorsal osteotomy in a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction.  The same wires were also used as guide wires for the insertion of a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed System upon insertion of the screws, which was accomplished using AO technique.  The wires were removed.  Fixation on the table was found to be excellent.  Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was anatomical.  The remaining bony prominence from the shaft of the first left metatarsal was then resected with a sagittal saw.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  The incision site was reinforced with Steri-Strips.  At this time, the patient's left ankle tourniquet was deflated.  The time was 45 minutes.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and an Ace bandage.  The patient's left foot was then placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then transferred to the recovered room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given pain medication and instructions on how to control her postoperative course.

She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track signs are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  The patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision was reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space was encountered.  There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The walls of the wound were explored.  There was no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she was alert.  She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.

4,"PROCEDURE: , Bilateral L5, S1, S2, and S3 radiofrequency ablation.,INDICATION: , Sacroiliac joint pain.,INFORMED CONSENT: , The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.,The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,PROCEDURE: , Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.,The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.,With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.,The following technique was used to confirm correct placement.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration.  No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts.  Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue.  After completion, a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 80 degrees for 90 seconds.,All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.,ADDITIONAL DETAILS:  ,None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISCUSSION: , Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.,The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.,Follow up appointment was made at PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately one to two weeks.orthopedic, sacroiliac joint pain, sacroiliac, teflon coated needle, fluoroscopy, needle placement, radiofrequency ablation, ablation, tissue, lidocaine, needle,"
1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe neurologic or neurogenic scoliosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe neurologic or neurogenic scoliosis.,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  Anterior spine fusion from T11-L3.,2.  Posterior spine fusion from T3-L5.,3.  Posterior spine segmental instrumentation from T3-L5, placement of morcellized autograft and allograft.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a severe scoliosis.  This was found to be moderately corrected.  Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy.,INDICATIONS: , The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate lines were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed as well.,He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed.  The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later.,The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This was over 5 levels.  Disks and endplates were then removed.  Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well.  Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl.  This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape.,The patient was then rotated into a prone position.  The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.,Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned.  This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side.  The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This was done using pulsed lavage.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed.  The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.  All instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.,The patient will be managed in the ICU and then on the floor as indicated.neurosurgery, anterior spine fusion, posterior spine fusion, spine segmental instrumentation, dry sterile dressings, autograft and allograft, pds sutures, spinous processes, spine fusion, spine, instrumentation, morcellized, allograft, fusion, autograft, "

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nasal obstruction secondary to deviated nasal septum.,2.  Bilateral turbinate hypertrophy.,PROCEDURE:,  Cosmetic rhinoplasty.  Request for cosmetic change in the external appearance of the nose.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old white female with longstanding nasal obstruction.  She also has concerns with regard to the external appearance of her nose and is requesting changes in the external appearance of her nose.  From her functional standpoint, she has severe left-sided nasal septal deviation with compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy.  From the aesthetic standpoint, the nose is over projected, lacks rotation, and has a large dorsal hump.  First we are going to straighten the nasal septum and reduce the size of the turbinates and then we will also take down the hump, rotate the tip of the nose, and de-project the nasal tip.  I explained to her the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications for postsurgical procedure.  She had her questions asked and answered and requested that we proceed with surgery as outlined above.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The face, head, and neck were sterilely prepped and draped.  The nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with a left hemitransfixion incision, which was brought down into the left intercartilaginous incision.  Right intercartilaginous incision was also made and the dorsum of the nose was elevated in the submucoperichondrial and subperiosteal plane.  Intact bilateral septomucoperichondrial flaps were elevated and a severe left-sided nasal septal deviation was corrected by detachment of the caudal nasal septum from the maxillary crest in a swinging door fashion and placing it back into the midline.  Posterior vomerine spur was divided superiorly and inferiorly and a large spur was removed.  Anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate was clamped, cut, and resected.  The upper lateral cartilages were divided from their attachments to the dorsal nasal septum and the cartilaginous septum was lowered by approximately 2 mm.  The bony hump of the nose was lowered with a straight osteotome by 4 mm.  Fading medial osteotomies were carried out and lateral osteotomies were then created in order to narrow the bony width of the nose.  The tip of the nose was then addressed via a retrograde dissection and removal of cephalic caudal semicircle cartilage medially at the tip.  The caudal septum was shortened by 2 mm in an angle in order to enhance rotation.  Medial crural footplates were reattached to the caudal nasal septum with a projection rotation control suture of #3-0 chromic.  The upper lateral cartilages were rejoined to the dorsal septum with a #4-0 plain gut suture.  No middle valves or bone grafts were necessary.  Intact mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture and Doyle nasal splints were placed on either side of the nasal septum.  The middle meatus was filled with Surgicel and Cortisporin otic and external Denver splint was applied with sterile tape and Mastisol.  Excellent aesthetic and functional results were thus obtained and the patient was awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room in good condition.ent - otolaryngology, nasal obstruction, cosmetic, dorsal hump, endotracheal tube, hemitransfixion incision, hypertrophy, intercartilaginous, intercartilaginous incision, nasal septum, nasal tip, septomucoperichondrial, submucoperichondrial, subperiosteal, turbinate, vomerine, spur, nasal septal, nasal, rhinoplasty, septum, "

The patient had a marked dorsal hump, which was both bony and cartilaginous in nature.,2.  The patient had marked hypertrophy of his nasalis muscle bilaterally contributing to the soft tissue dorsal hump.,3.  The patient had a C-shaped deformity to the left before he had tip ptosis.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who is status post blunt trauma to the nose approximately 9 months with the second episode 2 weeks following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity.  The patient was evaluated, but did not complain of nasal obstruction, and his main complaint was his cosmetic deformity.  He was found to have a C-shaped deformity to the left as well as some tip ptosis.  The patient was recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defect.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining a full consent from the patient, identified the patient, prepped with Betadine, brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  The appropriate Esmarch was placed; and after adequate sedation, the patient was subsequently intubated without difficulty.  The endotracheal tube was then secured, and the table was then turned clockwise to 90 degrees.  Three Afrin-soaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally.  The septum was then injected with 3 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally.  Then, 50 additional mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplasty.,Procedure was begun by first marking a columellar incision.  This incision was made using a #15 blade.  A lateral transfixion incision was then made bilaterally using a #15 blade, and then, the columellar incision was completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crura.  However, there was a dissection injury to the left medial crura.  Dissection was then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilages and then on to the upper lateral cartilage.  Once we reached the nasal bone, a Freer was used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion.  Once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structures, we appreciated a very large dorsal hump, which was made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portions.  There was also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage.  There was also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump.  The skin was contributing to the patient's cosmetic deformity.  In addition, we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage.  This mucocele was attempted to be dissected free, most of which was removed via dissection.  We then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a Rubin osteotome.  The dorsal hump was taken down and passed off the table.  Examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage.  This was passed off to use later for possible onlay grafts.  There was now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue.  A septoplasty was then performed throughout and a Kelly incision on the right side.  Subperichondrial planes were elevated on the right side, and then, a cartilage was incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side.  A 2 x 3-cm piece of the cardinal cartilage was then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut.  This cartilage was passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut grafts measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformities.  The spreader grafts were sewn in place using three interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally.  Once these were placed, we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof.  Lateral osteotomies were made with 2-mm osteotomes bilaterally.  The nasal bones were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity, and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum.  We then proceeded to the tip.  A cartilaginous strut was then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum.  It was approximately 15 mm long.  This was placed, and a pocket was just formed between the medial crura.  This pocket was taken down to the nasal spine, and then, the strut graft was placed.  The intradermal sutures were then placed using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition.  The intradermal sutures were then placed to help to align the nasal tip.  The cartilage strut was then sutured in place to the medial crura after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crura in the area of the plane suturing.  Prior to the intradermal suturing, the vestibular skin was also taken off in the area of the dome.,The columellar strut was then sutured in place using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot.  The patient had good tip support after this maneuver.  We then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the Rubin osteotome.  This was done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen, which is a radiated collagen.  The autogenous cartilage was wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion, and then, a 4-0 chromic suture was placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,The dorsal onlay was then sewn into position, and then, the 4-0 chromic suture was brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft.  Once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft, the graft was then sutured in place using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing sutures inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilages.  Once we were happy with the placement of this, we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally, and this was done using a #6 and then followed with a #3 push grafts.  This wrapping was performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,I went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformities as well as placement of the columellar strut, we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection; and therefore, we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon; and this was sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures.,At this point, we were happy with the test results, although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness.  There do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore, we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point.  The septum was reapproximated using a fast-absorbing 4-0 suture and a Keith needle placed in the mattress fashion.  The Kelly incision was closed using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing gut suture.  Doyle splints were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 3-0 monofilament suture.  The columellar skin was reapproximated using interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures, and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin was closed using interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures.,At the end of the procedure, all sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct.  A Denver external splint was then applied.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and transported to Anesthesia Care Unit in good condition.nan"

Using modified Seldinger technique a 6 French introducer sheath inserted into the right femoral artery.  Next, 6 French 3D right coronary catheter was inserted and right coronary angiogram was obtained in various projections.  Next, a 6 French JL4.0 left coronary catheter was inserted and left coronary angiogram was obtained in various projections.  Next, 4 French pigtail catheter was inserted into left ventricle under fluoroscopic guidance.  Left ventricular angiogram was performed.  Pre and post angiogram LVEDP, LV, and aortic pressures were obtained.  At the end of the procedure catheters were removed and the introducer sheath was secured.

Bilateral submucous resection of the inferior turbinates.,3.  Bilateral outfracture of the inferior turbinates.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal tube.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal less than 25 cc.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of chronic nasal obstruction.  On physical examination, she was derived to have a severely deviated septum with an S-shape deformity as well as turbinate hypertrophy present along the inferior turbinates contributing to the obstruction.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operating Suite where she was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away.  Nasal pledgets saturated with 4 cc of 10% cocaine solution were inserted into the nasal cavities.  These were then removed and the nasal septum as well as the turbinates were localized with the mixture of 1% lidocaine with 1:100000 epinephrine solution.  The nasal pledgets were then reinserted as the patient was prepped in the usual fashion.  The nasal pledgets were again removed and the turbinates as well as an infraorbital nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine solution.  The nasal vestibules were then cleansed with a pHisoHex solution.  A #15 blade scalpel was then used to make an incision along the length of the caudal septum.  The mucoperichondrial junction was then identified with the aid of cotton-tipped applicator as well as the stitch scissor.  Once the plane was identified, the mucosal flap on the left side of the septum was elevated with the aid of a Cottle.  At this point it should be mentioned that the patient's septum was significantly deviated with a large S-shape deformity obstructing both the right and left nasal cavity with the convex portion present in the left nasal cavity.  Again, the Cottle elevator was used to raise the mucosal flap down to the level of the septal spur.  At this point, the septal knife was used to make a crossover incision through the cartilage just anterior to the septal spur.  Again, the mucosal flap was elevated in the right nasal septum.  Now Knight scissors were used to remove the ascending portion of the nasal cartilage, which was then removed with a Takahashi forceps.  A Cottle elevator was used to further elevate the mucosal flap off the septal spur on the left side.  Removal of the spur was performed with the aid of the septal knife as well as a 3 mm straight chisel.  Once all ascending cartilage has been removed, inspection of the nasal cavity revealed patent passages with the exception of inferior turbinates that were very hypertrophied and was felt to be contributing to the patient's symptoms.  Therefore, the turbinates were again localized and a #15 blade scalpel was used to make a vertical incision dissected down to the chondral bone.  The XPS microdebrider with the inferior turbinate blade was then inserted through the incision and a submucous resection was performed by passing the microdebrider along the length of the bone.  Once the submucosal tissue had been resected, an outfracture procedure was performed so as to fully open the nasal passages.  Inspection revealed very patent and nonobstructive nasal passages.  Now the caudal incision was reapproximated with #4-0 chromic suture.  Finally, a #4-0 fast absorbing plain gut suture was used to approximate the mucosal surface of the septum in a running whipstitch fashion.  Finally, Merocel packing was placed and the patient was retuned to the Department of Anesthesia for awakening and taken to the recovery room without incident.surgery, chronic nasal obstruction, nasal septum, inferior turbinate hypertrophy, nasal septal reconstruction, submucous resection, inferior turbinates, outfracture, nasal septal, nasal pledgets, nasal cavity, nasal obstruction, turbinate hypertrophy, mucosal flap, septal, septum, turbinates, nasal, cavity, chronic, hypertrophy, obstruction, mucosal,"

4,"SUMMARY OF CLINICAL HISTORY:,  The patient was a 35-year-old African-American male with no significant past medical history who called EMS with shortness of breath and chest pain.  Upon EMS arrival, patient was tachypneic at 40 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 90%.  At the scene, EMS administered breathing treatments and checked lung sounds that did not reveal any evidence of fluid in the lung fields.  EMS also reports patient was agitated upon their arrival at his residence.  Two minutes after arrival at UTMB at 1500, the patient became unresponsive, apneic, and had oxygen saturations from 80-90%.  The patient's heart rate decreased to asystole, was intubated with good breath sounds and air movement.  Patient then had wide complex bradycardia and ACLS protocol for pulseless electrical activity was followed for 45 minutes.  The patient was administered TPA with no improvement.  Bedside echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion.  The patient was administered D5W, Narcan, and multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate.  The patient had three episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation with cardioversion/defibrillation resulting in asystole.  The patient was pronounced dead at 1605 with fixed, dilated pupils, no heart sounds, no pulse and no spontaneous respirations.,DESCRIPTION OF GROSS LESIONS,EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:,  The body is that of a 35-year-old well-developed, well-nourished male.  There is no peripheral edema of the extremities.  There is an area of congestion/erythema on the upper chest and anterior neck.  There are multiple small areas of hemorrhage bilaterally in the conjunctiva.  A nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are in place.  There is an intravenous line in the right hand and left femoral region.  The patient has multiple lead pads on the thorax.  The patient has no other major surgical scars.,INTERNAL EXAMINATION (BODY CAVITIES):,  The right and left pleural cavity contains 10 ml of clear fluid with no adhesions.  The pericardial sac is yellow, glistening without adhesions or fibrosis and contains 30 ml of a straw colored fluid.  There is minimal fluid in the peritoneal cavity.,HEART:,  The heart is large with a normal shape and a weight of 400 grams.  The pericardium is intact.  The epicardial fat is diffusely firm.  As patient was greater than 48 hours post mortem, no TTC staining was utilized.  Upon opening the heart was grossly normal without evidence of infarction.  There were slightly raised white plaques in the left ventricle wall lining.  The left ventricle measures 2.2 cm, the right ventricle measures 0.2 cm, the tricuspid ring measures 11 cm, the pulmonic right measures 8 cm, the mitral ring measures 10.2 cm, and the aortic ring measures 7 cm.  The foramen ovale is closed.  The circulation is left dominant.  Examination of the great vessels of the heart reveals minimal atherosclerosis with the area of greatest stenosis (20% stenosis) at the bifurcation of the LAD.,AORTA:,  There is minimal atherosclerosis with no measurable plaques along the full length of the ascending and descending aorta.,LUNGS: , The right lung weighed 630 grams, the left weighed 710 grams.  The lung parenchyma is pink without evidence of congestion of hemorrhage.  The bronchi are grossly normal.  In the right lung, there are two large organizing thrombo-emboli.  The first is located at the first branch of the pulmonary artery with an older, organizing area adherent to the vessel wall measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 2.5 cm.  Surrounding this organizing area is a newer area of apparent thrombosis completely occluding the bifurcation.  The other large organizing, adherent embolus is located further in out in the vasculature measuring approximately 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.5 cm.  There are multiple other emboli located in smaller pulmonary vessels that show evidence of distending the vessels they are located inside.,GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:,  The esophagus and stomach are normal in appearance without evidence of ulcers or varices.  The stomach contains approximately 800 ml, without evidence of any pills or other non-foodstuff material.  The pancreas shows a normal lobular cut surface with evidence of autolysis.  The duodenum, ileum, jejunum and colon are all grossly normal without evidence of abnormal vasculature or diverticula.  An appendix is present and is unremarkable.  The liver weighs 2850 grams and the cut surface reveals a normal liver with no fibrosis present grossly.  The gallbladder is in place with a probe patent bile duct through to the ampulla of Vater.,RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM:,  The spleen is large weighing 340 grams, the cut surface reveals a normal appearing white and red pulp.  No abnormally large lymph nodes were noted.,GENITOURINARY SYSTEM:,  The right kidney weighs 200 grams, the left weighs 210 grams.  The left kidney contains a 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 simple cyst containing a clear fluid.  The cut surface reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla with intact calyces.  The prostate and seminal vessels were cut revealing normal appearing prostate and seminal vesicle tissue without evidence of inflammation or embolus.,ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:,  The adrenal glands are in the normal position and weigh 8.0 grams on the right and 11.6 grams on the left.  The cut surface of the adrenal glands reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla.  The thyroid gland weighs 12.4 grams and is grossly normal.,EXTREMITIES:,  Both legs and calves were measured and found to be very similar in circumference.  Both legs were also milked and produced no clots in the venous system.,CLINICOPATHOLOGIC CORRELATION,This patient died shortly after a previous pulmonary embolus completely occluded the right pulmonary artery vasculature., ,The most significant finding on autopsy was the presence of multiple old and new thromboemboli in the pulmonary vasculature of the right lung.  The autopsy revealed evidence of multiple emboli in the right lung that were at least a few days old because the emboli that were organizing were adherent to the vessel wall.  In order to be adherent to the vessel wall, the emboli must be in place long enough to evoke a fibroblast response, which takes at least a few days.  The fatal event was not the old emboli in the right lung, but rather the thrombosis on top of the large saddle thrombus residing in the pulmonary artery.  This created a high-pressure situation that the right ventricle could not handle resulting in cardiac dysfunction and ultimately the patient's demise.,Although this case is fairly straight forward in terms of what caused the terminal event, perhaps the more interesting question is why a relatively healthy 35-year-old man would develop a fatal pulmonary embolism.  Virchow's triad suggests we should investigate endothelial injury, stasis and a hypercoagulable state as possible etiologies.  The age of the patient probably precludes venous stasis as the sole reason for the embolus although it could have certainly contributed.  The autopsy revealed no evidence of endothelial damage in the pulmonary vasculature that would have caused the occlusion.  The next logical reason would be a hypercoagulable state.  Some possibilities include obesity, trauma, surgery, cancer, Factor V Leiden deficiency (as well as other inherited disorders-prothrombin gene mutation, deficiencies in protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III, and disorders of plasminogen), and Lupus anticoagulant.  Of these risks factors, obesity was the only risk factor the patient was known to have.  The patient had no evidence of trauma, surgery, cancer or the stigmata of SLE, therefore these are unlikely.  Perhaps the most fruitful search would be an examination of the genetic possibilities for a hypercoagulable state (Factor V Leiden being the most common).,In summary, this patient died of a pulmonary embolism, the underlying cause of which is currently undetermined.  A definitive diagnosis may be ascertained with either genetic or other laboratory tests and a more detailed history.,SUMMARY AND REFLECTION,WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS AUTOPSY:,  I learned that although a cause of death may sometimes be obvious, the underlying mechanism for the death may still be elusive.  This patient was an otherwise completely healthy 35-year-old man with one known risk factor for a hypercoagulable state.,REMAINING UNANSWERED QUESTIONS:,  Basically the cause of the hypercoagulable state is undetermined.  Once that question is answered I believe this autopsy will have done a great service for the patient's family.nan"

In addition, there were subtle T2 signal changes in the right frontal, right parietal, and left parietal regions as seen previously on her local MRI can. In addition, special FLAIR imaging showed increased signal in the right frontal region consistent with ischemia.,She underwent Cerebral Angiography on 2/22/96. This revealed decreased flow and vessel narrowing the candelabra branches of the RMCA supplying the right frontal lobe. These changes corresponded to the areas of ischemic changes seen on MRI. There was also segmental narrowing of the caliber of the vessels in the circle of Willis. There was a small aneurysm at the origin of the LPCA. There was narrowing in the supraclinoid portion of the RICA and the proximal M1 and A1 segments. The study was highly suggestive of vasculitis.,2/23/96, Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed no evidence of retinal vasculitic change.

No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,SKIN:  Significant environmental actinic skin damage.,I recommended excision of basal cell cancers with frozen section control of the margin, closure will require local tissue flaps.  I recommended exchange of the implants with reaugmentation.  No final size is guaranteed or implied.  We will decrease the size of the implants based on the intraoperative findings as the size is not known.  Several options are available.  Sizer implants will be placed to best estimate postoperative size.  Ptosis will be worse following capsulectomy and going with a smaller implant.  She may require a lift in the future.  We have obtained preoperative clearance from the patient's cardiologist, Dr. K.  The patient has been taken off Coumadin for five days and will be placed back on Coumadin the day after the surgery.  The risk of deep venous thrombosis is discussed.  Other risk including bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, pain, scarring, hypertrophic scarring and poor cosmetic resolve, worsening of ptosis, exposure, extrusion, the rupture of the implants, numbness of the nipple-areolar complex, hematoma, need for additional surgery, recurrent capsular contracture and recurrence of the skin cancer was all discussed, which she understands and informed consent is obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,After appropriate informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the preoperative holding area with **** input.  She was then taken to the major operating room with ABCD Surgery Center, placed in a supine position.  Intravenous antibiotics were given.  TED hose and SCDs were placed.  After the induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Sites for excision and skin cancers were carefully marked with 5 mm margin.  These were injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.,After allowing adequate time for basal constriction hemostasis, excision was performed, full thickness of the skin.  They were tagged at the 12 o'clock position and sent for frozen section.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Once margins were determined to be free of involvement, local tissue flaps were designed for advancement.  Undermining was performed.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Closure was performed under moderate tension with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed under loop magnification paying meticulous attention and cosmetic details with 6-0 Prolene.  Attention was then turned to the breast, clothes were changed, gloves were changed, incision was planned and the previous inframammary incision beginning on the right incision was made.  Dissection was carried down to the capsule.  It was extremely calcified.  Dissection of the anterior surface of the capsule was performed.  The implant was subglandular, the capsule was entered, implant was noted to be grossly intact; however, there was free silicone.  Implant was removed and noted to be ruptured.  No marking as to the size of the implant was found.,Capsulectomy was performed leaving a small portion in the axilla in the inframammary fold.  Pocket was modified to medialize the implant by placing 2-0 Prolene laterally in mattress sutures to restrict the pocket.  In identical fashion, capsulectomy was performed on the left.  Implant was noted to be grossly ruptured.  No marking was found for the size of the implant.  The entire content was weighed and found to be 350 grams.  Right side was weighed and noted to be 338 grams, although some silicone was lost in the transfer and most likely was identical 350 grams.  The implants appeared to be double lumen with the saline portion deflated.  Completion of the capsulectomy was performed on the left.nan"

He was rendered unconscious by the head injury.  He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi.  This workup was negative.  The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker.  The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma.  There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes.  I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity.  The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion.  There was a roll beneath the right shoulder.  The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia.  Weitlaner retractors were inserted.  A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle.  I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis.  A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm.  The bone was set aside.  The dura was clearly discolored and very tense.  The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade.  There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure.  Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity.  The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section.  The margins of the membrane were coagulated.  The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none.  The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon.  Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers.  Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.,FINDINGS: , Chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane.,I might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure.  Also, it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood.neurology, frontotemporal, weitlaner, calvarium, cookie cutter type, craniotomy, dura, frontotemporal craniotomy, galea, hematoma, subdural, subdural hematoma, syncopal, temporalis, subacute subdural hematoma, temporalis muscle,"

The patient reports that she has been having history of recurrent sinus infection, averages about three times per year.  During the time that she gets the sinus infections, she has nasal congestion, nasal drainage, and also generally develops an ear infection as well.  The patient does note that she has been having hearing loss.  This is particular prominent in the right ear now for the past three to four years.  She does note popping after blowing the nose.  Occasionally, the hearing will improve and then it plugs back up again.  She seems to be plugged within the nasal passage, more on the right side than the left and this seems to be year round issue with her.  She tried Flonase nasal spray to see if this help with this and has been taking it, but has not seen a dramatic improvement.  She has had a history of swallowing issues and that again secondary to the persistent postnasal drainage.  She feels that she is having a hard time swallowing at times as well.

The nipple inframammary fold distance is approximately 1.5 cm shorter than the fuller right breast.  The patient has bilateral Mentor-Smooth round moderate projection jell-filled mammary prosthesis, 225 cc.,The patient was marked in the upright position for mobilization of lateral skin flaps and increase in the length of the nipple inframammary fold distance.  She was then brought to the operating room and after satisfactory LMA anesthesia had been induced, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manger.  The patient received a gram of Kefzol prior to beginning the procedure.  The previous inverted T-scar was excised down to the underlying capsule of the breast implant.  The breast was carefully dissected off of the underlying capsule.  Care being taken to preserve the vascular supply to the skin and breast flap.  When the anterior portion of the breast was dissected free of the underlying capsule, the posterior aspect of the capsule was then dissected off of the underlying pectoralis muscle.  A posterior incision was made on the backside of the capsule at the proximate middle portion of the capsule and then reflected inferiorly thereby creating a superior based capsular flap.  The lateral aspects of the capsule were then opened and the inferior edge of the capsule was then sutured to the underside of the inframammary flap with 2-0 Monocryl statures.  Care was taken to avoid as much exposure of the implant, as well as damage to the implant.  When the flap had been created and advanced, hemostasis was obtained and the area copiously irrigated with a solution of Bacitracin 50,000 units, Kefzol 1 g, gentamicin 80 mg, and 500 cc of saline.  The lateral skin both medially and laterally were then completely freed and the vertical incision of the inverted T was then extended the 2 cm and sutured with a trifurcation suture of 2-0 Biosyn.  This lengthened the vertical portion of the mastopexy scar to allow for descent of the implant and roundness of the inferior pole of the left breast.  The remainder of the inverted T was closed with interrupted sutures of 3 and 2-0 Biosyn and the skin was closed with continuous suture of 5-0 nylon.  Bacitracin and a standard breast dressing were applied.,The anesthesia was terminated and the patient was recovered in the operating room.  Sponge, instrument, needle count reported as corrected.

3,"We discovered new T-wave abnormalities on her EKG.  There was of course a four-vessel bypass surgery in 2001.  We did a coronary angiogram.  This demonstrated patent vein grafts and patent internal mammary vessel and so there was no obvious new disease.,She may continue in the future to have angina and she will have nitroglycerin available for that if needed.,Her blood pressure has been elevated and so instead of metoprolol, we have started her on Coreg 6.25 mg b.i.d.  This should be increased up to 25 mg b.i.d. as preferred antihypertensive in this lady's case.  She also is on an ACE inhibitor.,So her discharge meds are as follows:,1.  Coreg 6.25 mg b.i.d.,2.  Simvastatin 40 mg nightly.,3.  Lisinopril 5 mg b.i.d.,4.  Protonix 40 mg a.m.,5.  Aspirin 160 mg a day.,6.  Lasix 20 mg b.i.d.,7.  Spiriva puff daily.,8.  Albuterol p.r.n. q.i.d.,9.

4,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: , Right C5-C6 herniated nucleus pulposus.,PRIMARY OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Anterior cervical discectomy at C5-6 and placement of artificial disk replacement.,SUMMARY:,  This is a pleasant, 43-year-old woman, who has been having neck pain and right arm pain for a period of time which has not responded to conservative treatment including ESIs.  She underwent another MRI and significant degenerative disease at C5-6 with a central and right-sided herniation was noted.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her and she wished to proceed with surgery.  She was interested in participating in the artificial disk replacement study and was entered into that study.  She was randomly picked for the artificial disk and underwent the above named procedure on 08/27/2007.  She has done well postoperatively with a sensation of right arm pain and numbness in her fingers.  She will have x-rays AP and lateral this morning which will be reviewed and she will be discharged home today if she is doing well.  She will follow up with Dr. X in 2 weeks in the clinic as per the study protocol with cervical AP and lateral x-rays with ring prior to the appointment.  She will contact our office prior to her appointment if she has problems.

2,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This 3-year-old male is brought by his mother with concerns about his eating.  He has become a very particular eater, and not eating very much in general.  However, her primary concern was he was vomiting sometimes after particular foods.  They had noted that when he would eat raw carrots, within 5 to 10 minutes he would complain that his stomach hurt and then vomit.  After this occurred several times, they stopped giving him carrots.  Last week, he ate some celery and the same thing happened.  They had not given him any of that since.  He eats other foods without any apparent pain or vomiting.  Bowel movements are normal.  He does have a history of reactive airway disease, intermittently.  He is not diagnosed with intrinsic asthma at this time and takes no medication regularly.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  He is on no medications.,ALLERGIES: , He has no known medicine allergies.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Weight:  31.5 pounds, which is an increase of 2.5 pounds since May.  Temperature is 97.1.  He certainly appears in no distress.  He is quite interested in looking at his books.,Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.,Lungs:  Clear.,Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.,Abdomen:  Soft without organomegaly, masses, or tenderness.,ASSESSMENT:,  Report of vomiting and abdominal pain after eating raw carrots and celery.  Etiology of this is unknown.,PLAN:,  I talked with mother about this.  Certainly, it does not suggest any kind of an allergic reaction, nor obstruction.  At this time, they will simply avoid those foods.  In the future, they may certainly try those again and see how he tolerates those.  I did encourage a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in his diet as a general principle.  If worsening symptoms, she is welcome to contact me again for reevaluation.soap / chart / progress notes, eating, foods, vomiting, reactive airway disease, raw carrots, carrots,"

Nonrestorable teeth.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,DURATION OF SURGERY:  ,1 hour and 22 minutes.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient was first seen by me on 08/23/2007, who is 4-year-old with hemophilia, who received infusion on Tuesdays and Thursdays and he has a MediPort.  Mom reported history of high fever after surgery and he has one seizure previously.  He has history of trauma to his front teeth and physician put him on antibiotics.  He was only cooperative for having me do a visual examination on his anterior teeth.  Visual examination revealed severe dental caries and dental abscess from tooth #E and his maxillary anterior teeth needed to be extracted.  Due to his young age and hemophilia, I felt that he would be best served to be taken to the hospital operating room.,OTHER PREPARATION:  ,The child was brought to the Hospital Day Surgery accompanied by his mother.  There, I met with her and discussed the needs of the child, types of restoration to be performed, and the risks, and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment.  After all her questions and concerns were addressed, she gave her informed consent to proceed with treatment.  The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed.  He was given factor for appropriately for his hemophilia prior to being taken back to the operating room.  Once he was cleared by Anesthesia, the child was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected.  Anesthesia was induced by mask.  The patient was then intubated with an oral tube and the tube was stabilized.  The head was wrapped and IV was started.  The head and neck were draped with sterile towels and the body was covered with a lead apron and sterile sheath.  A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond tonsillar pillars.  Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed.  Preoperative clinical photographs were taken.  Two posterior bitewing radiographs and two anterior periapical films were taken in the operating room with digital radiograph.  After the radiographs were taken, the lead shield was removed.,Prophylaxis was then performed using a prophy cup and fluoridated prophy paste.  The patient's teeth were rinsed well.  The patient's oral cavity was suctioned clean.  Clinical and radiographic examination followed and areas of decay were noted.  During the restorative phase, these areas of decay were incidentally removed.  Entry was made to the level of the dental-enamel junction and beyond as necessary to remove it.  Final caries removal was confirmed upon reaching hard, firm and sound dentin.,Teeth restored with composite ___________  bonded with a one-step bonding agent.  Teeth restored with amalgam had a dentin tubular seal placed prior to amalgam placement.  Non-restorable primary teeth would be extracted.  The caries were extensive and invaded the pulp tissues, pulp therapy was initiated using ViscoStat and then IRM pulpotomies.  Teeth treated in such a manner would then be crowned with stainless steel crowns.,Upon conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris.  The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided.  Postoperative clinical photographs were then taken.  The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction with visualization.  Topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.  At the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room, was taken to the recovery room, breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,FINDINGS: , This young patient presented with mild generalized marginal gingivitis, secondary to light generalized plaque accumulation and fair oral hygiene.  All primary teeth were present.  Dental carries were present on the following teeth:  Tooth B, OL caries, tooth C, M, L, S caries, tooth B, caries on all surfaces, tooth E caries on all surfaces, tooth F caries on all surfaces, tooth T caries on all surfaces, tooth H, lingual and facial caries, tooth I, caries on all surfaces, tooth L caries on all surfaces, and tooth S, all caries.  The remainder of his teeth and soft tissues were within normal limits.  The following restoration and procedures were performed.  Tooth B, OL amalgam, tooth C, M, L, S composite, tooth D, E, F, and G were extracted, tooth H, and L and separate F composite.  Tooth I is stainless steel crown, tooth L pulpotomy and stainless steel crown and tooth S no amalgam.  Sutures were also placed at extraction site D, E, S, and G.,CONCLUSION:  ,The mother was informed of the completion of the procedure.  She was given a synopsis of the treatment provided as well as written and verbal instructions for postoperative care.  She is to contact to myself with an event of immediate postoperative complications and after full recovery, he was discharged from recovery room in the care of his mother.  She was also given prescription for Tylenol with Codeine Elixir for postoperative pain control., "

4,"OPERATION PERFORMED:, Phacoemulsification of cataract and posterior chamber lens implant, right eye., ,ANESTHESIA:, Retrobulbar nerve block, right eye, ,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: ,The patient was brought to the operating room where local anesthetic was administered to the right eye followed by a dilute drop of Betadine and a Honan balloon.  Once anesthesia was achieved, the right eye was prepped with Betadine, rinsed with saline, and draped in a sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was placed and 4-0 silk sutures passed under the superior and inferior rectus muscles stabilizing the globe.  A fornix-based conjunctival flap was prepared superiorly from 10 to 12 o'clock and episcleral vessels were cauterized using a wet-field.  A surgical groove was applied with a 69 Beaver blade 1 mm posterior to the limbus in a frown configuration in the 10 to 12 o'clock position.  A lamellar dissection was carried anteriorly to clear cornea using a crescent knife.  A stab incision was applied with a Superblade at the 2 o'clock position at the limbus.  The chamber was also entered through the lamellar groove using a 3-mm keratome in a beveled fashion.  Viscoat was injected into the chamber and an anterior capsulorrhexis performed.  Hydrodissection was used to delineate the nucleus and the phacoemulsification tip was inserted into the chamber.  A deep linear groove was dissected through the nucleus vertically and the nucleus was rotated 90 degrees with the assistance of a spatula through the side-port incision.  A second groove was dissected perpendicular to the first and the nucleus was fractured into quadrants.  Each quadrant was emulsified under burst power within the capsular bag.  The epinuclear bowl was manipulated with vacuum, flipped into the iris plane, and emulsified under pulse power.  I&A was used to aspirate cortex from the capsular bag.  A scratcher was used to polish the capsule, and Viscoat was injected inflating the capsular bag and chamber.  The wound was enlarged with a shortcut blade to 5.5 mm.  The intraocular lens was examined, found to be adequate, irrigated with balanced salt, and inserted into the capsular bag.  The lens centralized nicely and Viscoat was removed using the I&A.  Balanced salt was injected through the side-port incision.  The wound was tested, found to be secure, and a single 10-0 nylon suture was applied to the wound with the knot buried within the sclera.  The conjunctiva was pulled over the suture, and Ancef 50 mg and Decadron 4 mg were injected sub-Tenon in the inferonasal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Maxitrol ointment was applied topically followed by an eye pad and shield.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was taken from the operating room in good condition.ophthalmology, retrobulbar nerve block, posterior chamber lens implant, phacoemulsification of cataract, lens implantation, capsular bag, cataract, phacoemulsification, nucleus, capsular, lens, eye"
2,"Doctor's Address,Dear Doctor:,This letter serves as a reintroduction of my patient, A, who will be seeing you on Thursday, 06/12/2008.  As you know, he is an unfortunate gentleman who has reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities.  His current symptoms are more severe on the right and he has had a persisting wound that has failed to heal on his right leg.  He has been through Wound Clinic to try to help heal this, but was intolerant of compression dressings and was unable to get satisfactory healing of this.  He has been seen by Dr. X for his pain management and was considered for the possibility of amputation being a therapeutic option to help reduce his pain.  He was seen by Dr. Y at Orthopedic Associates for review of this.  However, in my discussion with Dr. Z and his evaluation of Mr. A, it was felt that this may be an imprudent path to take given the lack of likelihood of reduction of his pain from his RST, his questionable healing of his wound given noninvasive studies that did reveal tenuous oxygenation of the right lower leg, and concerns of worsening of his RST symptoms on his left leg if he would have an amputation.  Based on the results of his transcutaneous oxygen levels and his dramatic improvement with oxygen therapy at this test, Dr. Z felt that a course of hyperbaric oxygen may be of utility to help in improving his wounds.  As you may or may not know we have certainly pursued aggressive significant measures to try to improve Mr. A's pain.  He has been to Cleveland Clinic for implantable stimulator, which was unsuccessful at dramatically improving his pain.  He currently is taking methadone up to eight tablets four times a day, morphine up to 100 mg three times a day, and Dilaudid two tablets by mouth every two hours to help reduce his pain.  He also is currently taking Neurontin 1600 mg three times a day, Effexor XR 250 mg once a day, Cytomel 25 mcg once a day, Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q. day, levothyroxine 300 mcg p.o. q. day, Prinivil 20 mg p.o. q. day, and Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q day.,I appreciate your assistance in determining if hyperbaric oxygen is a reasonable treatment course for this unfortunate situation.  Dr. Z and I have both tried to stress the fact that amputation may be an abrupt and irreversible treatment course that may not reach any significant conclusion.  He has been evaluated by Dr. X for rehab concerns to determine.  He agrees that a less aggressive form of therapy may be most appropriate.,I thank you kindly for your prompt evaluation of this kind gentleman in an unfortunate situation.  If you have any questions regarding his care please feel free to call me at my office.  Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you shortly after your evaluation.  Please feel free to call me if it is possible or if you have any questions about anything.letters, rsd, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, orthopedic, oxygenationNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

The patient was given multiple doses of morphine to maintain his comfort while here in the emergency room without any adverse effect.  The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department.  The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either.  Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free.  I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion.  It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer.  Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to.  I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion.  The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight.  The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice.  This was done.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match.  The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion.  There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength.  Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction.  Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder.  The patient was given a leg bag and the Foley catheter was left in place.,DIAGNOSES,1.  HEMATURIA.,2.  PROSTATE CANCER WITH BONE AND BLADDER METASTATIC DISEASE.,3.  SIGNIFICANT ANEMIA.,4.

4,"PROCEDURE:,  Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve.  Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve.  Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected.,Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized.  Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly.,The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.  The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass.  Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve.,A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures.  Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound.  The elbow was dressed and splinted.  The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.neurology, neurolysis, ulnar, periosteal, flexor-pronator mass, ulnar nerve transposition, medial intermuscular septum, nerve transposition, intermuscular septum, flexor pronator, ulnar nerve, nerve"

She was begun on Aricept but could not tolerate that because of strange thoughts and hallucinations.  She was found to be hypercalcemic.  Intact PTH was mildly elevated.  A sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound showed evidence of a right superior parathyroid adenoma.,FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A time out was taken so that the anesthesia personnel, nursing personnel, surgical team, and patient could confirm the patient's identity, operative site and operative plan.  The electronic medical record was reviewed as was the ultrasound.  The patient was sedated.  A small roll was placed behind the shoulders to moderately hyperextend the neck.  The head was supported in a foam head cradle.  The neck and chest were prepped with chlorhexidine and isolated with sterile drapes.  After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine along the planned incision, a transverse incision was made in the skin crease a couple of centimeters above the clavicular heads and carried down through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma.  The larger anterior neck veins were divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  Superior and inferior flaps were developed in the subplatysmal plane using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  The sternohyoid muscles were separated in the midline, and the right sternohyoid muscle was retracted laterally.  The right sternothyroid muscle was divided transversely with the cautery.  The right middle thyroid vein was divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  The right thyroid lobe was rotated leftward.  Posterior to the mid portion of the left thyroid lobe, a right superior parathyroid adenoma of moderate size was identified.  This was freed up and its pedicle was ligated with small Hemoclips and divided and the gland was removed.  It was sent for weight and frozen section.  It weighed 960 mg and on frozen section was consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.,Prior to the procedure, a peripheral blood sample had been obtained and placed in a purple top tube labeled ""pre-excision.""  It was our intention to monitor intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone 10 minutes after removal of this parathyroid adenoma.  However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma was high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH.  The neck was irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory.  The sternohyoid muscles were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.  The platysma was closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery area in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.hematology - oncology, parathyroid adenoma, superior parathyroid adenoma, excision, sestamibi parathyroid scan, sestamibi parathyroid, parathyroid scan, sternohyoid muscles, superior parathyroid, parathyroid, sestamibi, platysma, adenoma, ultrasound, sternohyoid, thyroid, muscles "

Her last visit to this clinic was approximately three months ago.  Since that time, the patient states that she has had some variability in her glucose control too largely to recent upper and lower respiratory illnesses.  She did not seek attention for these, and the symptoms have begun to subside on their own and in the meantime, she continues to have some difficulties with blood sugar management.  Her 14-day average is 191.  She had a high blood sugar this morning, which she attributed to a problem with her infusion set; however, in the clinic after an appropriate correction bolus, she subsequently became quite low.  She was treated appropriately with glucose and crackers, and her blood sugar came back up to over 100.  She was able to manage this completely on her own.

Her target pre-meal is 120 and bedtime is 150.  Her insulin/carbohydrate ratio is 10 and her correction factor is 60.  We are not going to make any changes to her insulin pump settings at this time.  I have encouraged her to watch the number of processed high-calorie foods that she is consuming late at night.  She has agreed to try that and cut back on this a little bit.  I want to get fasting labs to include her standard labs for us today but include a fasting C-peptide and a hemoglobin A1C, so that we can make arrangements for her to get an upgraded insulin pump.  She states to me that she has been having some battery problems in the recent past, although she says the last time that she went four weeks without having to change batteries and that is about the appropriate amount of time.  Nonetheless, she is out of warranty and we will try to get her a new pump.,Plan to see the patient back here in approximately two months, and we will try to get the new pump through Medicare.nan"

Left arthroscopic medial meniscoplasty of medial femoral condyle.,3.  Chondroplasty of the left knee as well.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 80 cc.,TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: , 19 minutes.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was taken to PACU in stable condition.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 41-year-old male with left knee pain for approximately two years secondary to hockey injury where he did have a prior MCL sprain.  He has had a positive symptomology of locking and pain since then.  He had no frank instability to it, however.,GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , We did find a tear to the medial meniscus as well as a large area of chondromalacia to the medial femoral condyle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was applied to the left thigh with adequate Webril padding, not inflated at this time.  After the left lower extremity had been prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, we applied an Esmarch tourniquet, exsanguinating the blood and inflated the tourniquet to 325 mmHg for a total of 19 minutes.  We established the lateral port of the knee with #11 blade scalpel.  We put in the arthroscopic trocar, instilled with water and inserted the camera.,On inspection of the patellofemoral joint, it was found to be quite smooth.  Pictures were taken there.  There was no evidence of chondromalacia, cracking, or fissuring of the articular cartilage.  The patella was well centered over the trochlear notch.  We then directed the arthroscope to the medial compartment of the knee.  It was felt that there was a tear to the medial meniscus.  We also saw large area of chondromalacia with grade-IV changes to bone over the medial femoral condyle.  This area was debrided with forceps and the arthroscopic shaver.  The cartilage was also smoothened over the medial femoral condyle.  This was curetted after the medial meniscus had been trimmed.  We looked into the notch.  We saw the ACL appeared stable, saw attachments to tibial as well as the femoral insertion with some evidence of laxity, wear and tear.  Attention then was taken to the lateral compartment with some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus and the arterial surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment.  All instruments were removed.  All loose cartilaginous pieces were suctioned from the knee and water was suctioned at the end.  We removed all instruments.  Marcaine was injected into the portal sites.  We placed a sterile dressing and stockinet on the left lower extremity.  He was transferred to the gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.surgery, medial meniscoplasty, arthroscopic, chondroplasty, arthroscopy, medial femoral condyle, medial meniscus, knee, meniscal, cartilage, meniscoplasty, meniscus, chondromalacia, condyle, femoral"

The patient was transferred to Nursing Home and presents today from the nursing home with complaints of bleeding from the right AKA stump and penile discharge.  As per the patient during his hospitalizations over here, he had indwelling Foley catheter for a few days and when he was discharged at the nursing home he was discharged without the catheter.  However, the patient was brought back to the ED today when he suffered fall yesterday and started bleeding from his stump.  While placing the catheter in the ED on retraction of foreskin purulent discharge was seen from the penis and the glans appeared infected, so urology consult was placed.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Negative except as in the HPI.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for end-stage renal disease on dialysis, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Right AKA,MEDICATIONS:,  Novolin, Afrin, Nephro-Vite, Neurontin, lisinopril, furosemide, Tums, labetolol, Plavix, nitroglycerin, Aricept, omeprazole, oxycodone, Norvasc, Renagel, and morphine.,ALLERGIES: , PENICILLIN and ADHESIVE TAPE.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, and myocardial infarction.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives alone.

Polyethylene exchange, left knee.,COMPLICATION: , None.,TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,58 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,INDICATIONS:  ,This patient underwent an uncomplicated left total knee replacement.  Postoperatively, unfortunately did not follow up with PT/INR blood test and he was taking Coumadin.  His INR was seemed to elevated and developed hemarthrosis.  Initially, it did look very benign, although over the last 24 hours it did become irritable and inflamed, and he therefore was indicated with the above-noted procedure.,This procedure as well as alternatives was discussed in length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for total knee revision, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  He understood them well.  All questions were answered and he signed consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed on operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The leg was elevated and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  A longitudinal incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous tissues.  This was made through the prior incision site.  There were some fatty necrotic tissues through the incision region and all necrotic tissue was debrided sharply on both sides of the incision site.  Medial and lateral flaps were then made.  The prior suture was identified, the suture removed and then a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then performed.  Effusion within the knee was noted.  All hematoma was evacuated.  I then did flex the knee and removed the polyethylene.  Once the polyethylene was removed I did irrigate the knee with total of 9 liters of antibiotic solution.  Further debridement was performed of all inflamed tissue and thickened synovial tissue.  A 6 x 16-mm Stryker polyethylene was then snapped back in position.  The knee has excellent stability in all planes and I did perform a light manipulation to improve the flexion of the knee.  Further irrigation was performed on the all soft tissue in the knee with additional 3 liters of normal saline.  The knee was placed in a flexed position and the extensor mechanism was reapproximated using #2 Ethibond suture in a figure-of-eight manner.  The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated using staples.  Prior to closure a Hemovac drain was inserted through a superolateral approach into the knee joint.,No complications were encountered throughout the procedure, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.surgery,"

He was referred for stereotactic radiosurgery.  The risks of the radiosurgical treatment were discussed with the patient including, but not limited to, failure to completely obliterate the AVM, need for additional therapy, radiation injury, radiation necrosis, headaches, seizures, visual loss, or other neurologic deficits.  The patient understands these risks and would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient arrived to Outpatient CyberKnife Suite one day prior to the treatment.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was constructed.  Initial imaging was obtained by the CyberKnife system.  The patient was then transported over to the CT scanner at Stanford.  Under the supervision of Dr. X, 125 mL of Omnipaque 250 contrast was administered.  Dr. X then supervised the acquisition of 1.2-mm contiguous axial CT slices.  These images were uploaded over the hospital network to the treatment planning computer, and the patient was discharged home.,Treatment plan was then performed by me.  I outlined the tumor volume.  Inverse treatment planning was used to generate the treatment plan for this patient.  This resulted in a total dose of 20 Gy delivered to 84% isodose line using a 12.5 mm collimator.  The maximum dose within this center of treatment volume was 23.81 Gy.  The volume treated was 2.972 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 1.9 x 2.7 x 1.6 cm.  The volume treated at the reference dose was 98%.  The coverage isodose line was 79%.  The conformality index was 1.74 and modified conformality index was 1.55.  The treatment plan was reviewed by me and Dr. Y of Radiation Oncology, and the treatment plan was approved.,On the morning of May 14, 2004, the patient arrived at the Outpatient CyberKnife Suite.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was applied.  Initial imaging was used to bring the patient into optimal position.  The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to deliver the 20 Gy to the AVM margin.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was given 8 mg of Decadron for prophylaxis and discharged home.,Followup will consist of an MRI scan in 6 months.  The patient will return to our clinic once that study is completed.,I was present and participated in the entire procedure on this patient consisting of CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital AVM.,Dr. X was present during the entire procedure and will be dictating his own operative note.neurology, ct-guided, occipital, cyberknife, frameless stereotactic radiosurgery, occipital arteriovenous malformation, conformality index, arteriovenous malformation, malformation, avm, arteriovenous,"
2,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  ,Followup of seizures.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 47-year-old African-American female, well known to the neurology service, who has been referred to me for the first time evaluation of her left temporal lobe epilepsy that was diagnosed in August of 2002.  At that time, she had one generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  Apparently she had been having several events characterized by confusion and feeling unsteady lasting for approximately 60 seconds.  She said these events were very paroxysmal in the sense they suddenly came on and would abruptly stop.  She had two EEGs at that time, one on August 04, 2002 and second on November 01, 2002, both of which showed rare left anterior temporal sharp waves during drowsiness and sleep.  She also had an MRI done on September 05, 2002, with and without contrast that was negative.  Her diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. X at Johns Hopkins Hospital who reviewed her studies as well as examined the patient and felt that actually her history and findings were consistent with diagnosis of left temporal lobe epilepsy.  She was initially started on Trileptal, but had some problems with the medication subsequently Keppra, which she said made her feel bad and subsequently changed in 2003 to lamotrigine, which she has been taking since then.  She reports no seizures in the past several years.  She currently is without complaint.,In terms of seizure risk factors she denies head trauma, history of CNS infection, history of CVA, childhood seizures, febrile seizures.  There is no family history of seizures.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant only for hypertension and left temporal lobe epilepsy.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Remarkable only for hypertension in her father.  Her mother died in a motor vehicle accident.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She works running a day care at home.  She has three children.  She is married.  She does not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Please see note in chart.

Mental status is normal, cranial nerves are intact, motor is normal bulk and tone throughout with no weakness appreciated in upper and lower extremities bilaterally.  There is no drift and there are no abnormalities to orbit.  Sensory examination, light touch, and temperature intact at all distal extremities.  Cerebellar examination, she has normal finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movements, heel-to-shin, and foot tap.,She rises easily from the chair.  She has normal step, stride, arm swing, toe, heel, and tandem.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and equal at biceps, brachioradialis, patella, and 1 at the ankles.,She was seen in the emergency room for chest pain one month ago.  CT of the head was performed, which I reviewed, dated September 07, 2006.  The findings were within the range of normal variation.  There is no evidence of bleeding, mass, lesions, or any evidence of atrophy.,IMPRESSION: , This is a pleasant 47-year-old African-American female with what appears to be cryptogenic left temporal lobe epilepsy that is very well controlled on her current dose of lamotrigine.,PLAN:,1.  Continue lamotrigine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.,2.  I discussed with the patient the option of a trial of medications.  We need to repeat her EEG as well as her MRI prior to weaning her medications.  The patient wants to continue her lamotrigine at this time.  I concur.,3.  The patient will be following up with me in six months.,nan"
2,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 41-year-old registered nurse (R.N.).  She was admitted following an overdose of citalopram and warfarin.  The patient has had increasing depression and has been under stress as a result of dissolution of her second marriage.  She notes starting in January, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  It turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  The patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  They had moved to ABCD where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  She also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  She has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  Some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  In January, she went on citalopram.  She reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, has trouble sleeping at night, thinks perhaps her mood got worse on the citalopram, which is possible, though it is also possible that the progressive nature of getting divorce than financial problems has contributed to her worsening mood.,PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , She was born in XYZ.  She describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  Father was a truckdriver.  She is an only child.  She reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  In her 20s, she served six years in Naval Reserve.  She was previously married for four years.  She described that as an abusive relationship.  She had a history of being in counseling with ABC, but does not think this therapist, who is now by her estimate 80 years old, is still in practice.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL:  This is an alert and cooperative woman.,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 60, respirations 18, blood pressure 95/54, oxygen saturation 95%, and weight is 132.,PSYCHIATRIC:  She makes good eye contact.  Speech is normal in rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary.  There is no thought disorder.  She denies being suicidal.  Her affect is appropriate for material being discussed.  She has a sense of future, wants to get back to work, has plans to return to counseling.  She appeared to have normal orientation, concentration, memory, and judgment.,Medical history is notable for factor V Leiden deficiency, history of pulmonary embolus, restless legs syndrome.  She has been off her Mirapex.  I did encourage her to go back on the Mirapex, which would likely lead to some improvement in mood by facilitating better sleep.,The patient at this time can contract for safety.  She has made plans for outpatient counseling this Saturday and we will get a referral to a psychiatrist for which she is agreeable to following up with.,LABORATORY DATA: , INR, which is still 8.8.  In 1998, she had a normal MRI.  Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and CBC were all normal.,DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Seasonal depressive disorder.,2.  Restless legs syndrome.,3.  Overdose of citalopram and warfarin.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , The patient reports she has been feeling better since discontinuing antidepressants.  I, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  If needed, she can take Prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  She does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with Prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information I can provide.consult - history and phy., citalopram, depressive disorder, overdose, warfarin, restless legs syndrome, disorder, mood"

He was given Xopenex treatment, because of his respiratory distress.  Carotid ultrasound was reviewed and revealed a 50 to 69% obstruction of left internal carotid.  Dr. X saw him in consultation and recommended CT angiogram.  This showed no significant obstructive lesion other than what was known on the ultrasound.  Head MRI was done and revealed the above findings.  The patient was begun on PT and improved.  By discharge, he had much improved strength in his right arm.  He had no further progressions.  His cough improved with oral Zithromax and nebulizer treatments.  His platelets also improved as well.  By discharge, his platelets was up to 107,000.  His H&H was stable at 41.7 and 14.6 and his white count was 4300 with a normal differential.  Chest x-ray revealed a mild elevated right hemidiaphragm, but no infiltrate.

At baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences.  His speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten.  He ambulates independently, but falls often.  He has difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left.  Mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running.  He is being followed by Medical Therapy Unit and has also been seen in the past by Dr. X.  He has not received Botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy.,The patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt has done well.,The patient developed seizures about 2 years ago.  These occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side.  His events, however, always tend to be prolonged.  He has had seizures as long as an hour and a half.  He tends to require multiple medications to stop them.  He has been followed by Dr. Y and was started on Trileptal.  At one point, The patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures.  He was more recently placed on Topamax since March 2007.  His last seizures were in March and May respectively.  He is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.,The patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure.  His seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right.  Family administered Diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose.  They did not know they could repeat this dose.  EMS was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin.

His cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  His extraocular movements are intact.  His visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  His face shows left facial weakness postictally.  His palate elevates midline.  Vision is intact bilaterally.  Tongue protrudes midline.,Motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline.  His left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight.  He has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects, shows exaggerated tremor/dysmetria.  Right upper extremity is much more on target.  His sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  When sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis.  He also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point.  Gait was not tested today.,IMPRESSION: , This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence.  I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance.  The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  He may benefit from Botox.,In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.  They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call EMS at any point during that time.  Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them.  Other medication options would include Keppra, Zonegran or Lamictal.,FOLLOWUP: , Followup has already been scheduled with Dr. Y in February and they will continue to keep that date for followup.nan"
3,"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.nan"
3,"PROCEDURE:  ,Caudal epidural steroid injection without fluoroscopy.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local sedation.,VITAL SIGNS: , See nurse's records.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , INT was placed.  The patient was in the prone position.  The back was prepped with Betadine.  Lidocaine 1.5% was used to make a skin wheal over the sacral hiatus.  A 18-gauge Tuohy needle was then placed into the epidural space.  There were no complications from this (no blood or CSF).  After negative aspiration was performed, a mixture of 10 cc preservative free normal saline plus 160 mg preservative free Depo-Medrol was injected.  Neosporin and band-aid were applied over the puncture site.  The patient was then placed in supine position.  The patient was discharged to outpatient recovery in stable condition.pain management, epidural space, epidural steroid injection, caudal epidural, caudal, fluoroscopy, steroid, epidural, injection"
1,"TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Total laryngectomy, right level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection, tracheoesophageal puncture, cricopharyngeal myotomy, right thyroid lobectomy.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , A 58-year-old gentleman who has had a history of a T3 squamous cell carcinoma of his glottic larynx having elected to undergo a laser excision procedure in late 06/07.  Subsequently, biopsy confirmed tumor persistence in the right glottic region.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgical intervention versus possibility of chemoradiation therapy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Also concerned for a CT scan finding of possible cartilaginous invasion at the cricoid level.  The patient understood the issues regarding surgical intervention and wished to undergo a surgical intervention despite a clear understanding of risks, benefits, and alternatives.  He was accompanied by his wife and daughter.  Risks included, but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury of the nerves including lower lip weakness, tongue weakness, tongue numbness, shoulder weakness, need for physical therapy, possibility of total laryngectomy, possibility of inability to speak or swallow, difficulty eating, wound care issues, failure to heal, need for additional treatment, and the patient understood all of these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  After the establishment of the general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation, the patient had his eyes protected with Tegaderm.  A #6 endotracheal tube was placed initially.  Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Lindholm laryngoscope.  A 0-degree endoscope was used to take pictures of what was apparently a recurrence of tumor along the right true vocal fold extending into the anterior arytenoid area and extending about 1 cm below into the subglottis.  Subsequently, a decision was then made to go ahead and perform the surgical intervention.  A hemi-apron incision was employed, and 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied after the patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, a hemi-apron incision was performed.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised at the hyoid bone into the clavicle.  Attention was then turned to the right side, where a level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection was performed.  Submandibular fascia was appreciated inferiorly along the submandibular gland, this was incised allowing for identification of the digastric muscle.  Digastric tunnel was performed posteriorly to the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia along the sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected along the anterior aspect until the cranial nerve XI was identified.  Level 2A contents were then dissected off the floor of the neck including levels 3 and 4.  Preservation of the phrenic nerve was obtained by identification, and subsequently cross-clamping fibrofatty tissue and lymph nodes just adjacent to the jugular vein inferiorly at level 4.  The specimen was then mobilized over the internal jugular vein with preservation of hypoglossal nerve.  Levels 2, 3, 4 neck dissection specimens were then labeled appropriately, attached with staples, and sent for histopathological evaluation.,Attention was then turned to attempting to perform a partial laryngectomy up front with a possibility of total laryngectomy as discussed.  Subsequently, the strap muscles were separated in the midline.  The trachea was identified in the midline.  The thyroid isthmus was plicated using the Harmonic scalpel, and attention was then turned to transecting the strap muscles at the superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage.  Once this was performed, sinuses were mobilized from the thyroid cartilage both on the right and left side respectively.  The cricothyroid joint was then freed on the left side and then on the right side with noting on the right side that this cartilage was a bit more irregular.  Attention was then turned to performing a cricothyrotomy.  Upon performing this, it was obvious that there was tumor just above the level of the cricothyrotomy incision.  A #7 anode tube was then placed in this area and secured.  Attention was then turned to performing the laryngotomy at the level of the petiole of epiglottis.  Subsequently, the cuts were made on the left side with visualization of the vocalis process and coming down to the level of the cricoid cartilage, and the thyroid cartilage was then intentionally fractured along the anterior spine.  It was evident that this tumor had extended more than 1 cm into the subglottic region.  Careful dissection of larynx from an inferior margin and portion of cricoid cartilage resection then was performed posteriorly, though it was evident that the cricoid cartilage was invaded.  Frozen section biopsy then confirmed this finding as read by Dr. X of Surgical Pathology.,In light of this finding with cartilaginous invasion and inability to preserve the cricoid cartilage, the patient's case was then converted into a total laryngectomy.  Subsequently, the trachea was transected at the level 3, 4 tracheal ring into cartilaginous space and anterior tracheal stoma was fashioned using 3-0 vertical mattress sutures for the skin.  A W-plasty was also performed to allow for enlargement of the stoma.  Attention was then turned to identifying the common parting wall of the trachea and the esophagus.  Attention was then turned to resecting the hyoid bone.  The remainder of the specimen cuts were made superior from sinus preserving a modest amount of pharyngeal mechanism.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Subsequently, a tracheoesophageal puncture site was performed using a right-angled hemostat at about approximately 1 cm from the posterior tracheal wall superior aspect.  Once this was performed, a running 3-0 canal stitch was used to close the pharynx.  Subsequently, interrupted 4-0 chromic stitches were then used as reinforcement line from superior to inferior, and fibrin glue was applied.  Two #10 JP drains were placed on the right side and one on the left side and secured appropriately with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was then closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for the platysma and staples for the skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the Weinberg Intensive Care Unit with the endotracheal tube still in place to be decannulated later.surgery, laryngectomy, neck dissection, tracheoesophageal, cricopharyngeal myotomy, thyroid lobectomy, squamous cell carcinoma, larynx, thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, total laryngectomy, thyroid, cartilage"
3,"INTERVAL HISTORY:,  ABC who is 10 years of age and carries a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, seen in the clinic today for routine follow-up visit.  He was accompanied by his adopted mother.  He is attending the fourth grade and has not missed significant days for illness.  He has a chronic cough that has been slightly increased for the prior 4 days.  Sputum is not produced.  Sinuses are described as clear.  He is an eager eater, eating a regular diet of increased calorie and protein.  He also was taking Resource just for kid juice boxes as well as chocolate milkmaid with half-and-half.  Belly complaints are denied.  He has 2 to 3 bowel movements per day.  He does need a flu vaccine.,MEDICATIONS: , Albuterol premix via nebulizer as needed, albuterol MDI 2 puffs b.i.d., therapy Vest daily, Creon 20 two with meals and snacks,  A-dec 2 tablets daily, Prevacid 15 mg daily, Advair 100/50 one inhalation twice daily, and MiraLax p.r.n.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Respiratory rate 20 and pulse 91.  Temperature is 100.0 per tympanic membrane.  Oximetry is 98% on room air.  Height is 128 cm, which is an increase of 1.0 cm from prior visit.  Weight is 24.5 kg, which is an increase of 500 grams from prior visit.,GENERAL:  He is a cooperative school-aged boy in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Tympanic membranes clear, throat with minimal postnasal drip.,CHEST:  Significant for 1+ hyperinflation.  Lungs are auscultated with good air entry and clear breath sounds.,CARDIAC:  Regular sinus rhythm without murmur.,ABDOMEN:  Palpated as soft, without hepatosplenomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  Not clubbed.,CHART REVIEW: , This chart was thoroughly reviewed prior to this conference by X, RN, BSN.  Review of chart indicates that mother has good adherence to treatment plan indicated by medications being refilled in a timely fashion as well as clinic contact documented with appropriate concerns.,DISCUSSION:  PHYSICIAN: , X did note that mother reported that the patient had discontinued the Pulmozyme due to CCS reasons.  He is not sure what this would be since CCS Pulmozyme is a covered benefit on CCS for children with cystic fibrosis.  This situation will be looked into with the hope of restarting soon.  Other than that the patient seems to be doing well.  A flu shot was given.,NURSE: , X, RN, BSN, did note that the patient was doing quite well.  Reinforcement of current medication regime was supplied.  No other needs identified at this time.,RESPIRATORY CARE: , X, RCP, did review appropriate sequencing of medications with the patient and family.  Once again, she was concerned the lack of Pulmozyme due to mom stating CCS issues.  At this time, they have increased the Vest use to twice daily and are doing 30-minute treatments.,DIETICIAN: , X, RD, CDE, notes that the patient is 89% of his ideal body weight, which is a nutritional failure per cystic fibrosis guidelines.  This is despite the fact that he has an excellent appetite.  Mom reports he is taking his enzymes consistently as well as vitamins.  He does have problems meeting his goal for resource drinks per day.  Since the patient has been struggling to gain weight this past year, we will need to monitor his nutritional status and weight trend very closely.  A variety of additional high calorie items were discussed with mom.,SOCIAL WORK: , X, LCSW, notes that mom has recently gradually from respiratory therapy school and has accepted a position here at Children's Hospital.  The patient is doing well in school.  With the exception of issues with CCS authorization, there appears to be no pressing social needs at this time.,IMPRESSION: , ,1.  Cystic fibrosis.,2.  Poor nutritional status.,PLAN:  ,1.  Give flu vaccine 0.5 mg IM now, this was done.,2.  Continue all other medications and treatment.,3.  Evaluate/investigate rationale for no authorization of Pulmozyme with CCS.,4.  Needs to augment current high-calorie diet to give more nutrition.  To follow advice by a dietician.,5.  Continue all the medication treatments before.,6.  To continue off and ongoing psychosocial nutritional counseling as necessary.nan"
3,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left mesothelioma, focal.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left pleural-based nodule.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Left thoracoscopy.,2.  Left mini thoracotomy with resection of left pleural-based mass.,FINDINGS:,  Left anterior pleural-based nodule, which was on a thin pleural pedicle with no invasion into the chest wall.,FLUIDS: , 800 mL of crystalloid.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,DRAINS, TUBES, CATHETERS: , 24-French chest tube in the left thorax plus Foley catheter.,SPECIMENS: , Left pleural-based nodule.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 59-year-old female with previous history of follicular thyroid cancer, approximately 40 years ago, status post resection with recurrence in the 1980s, who had a left pleural-based mass identified on chest x-ray.  Preoperative evaluation included a CT scan, which showed focal mass.  CT and PET confirmed anterior lesion.  Therefore the patient was seen in our thoracic tumor board where it was recommended to have resection performed with chest wall reconstruction.  In the outpatient setting, the patient was willing to proceed.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient identified correctly.  She was taken to the operating room where an epidural catheter was placed by Anesthesia without difficulty.  She was sedated and intubated with double-lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty.  She was positioned with left side up.  Appropriate pressure points were padded.  The left chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  The skin incision was made in the posterior axillary line, approximately 7th intercostal space with #10 blade, taken down through tissues and Bovie electrocautery.,Pleura was entered.  There was good deflation of the left lung.  __________ port was placed, followed by the 0-degree 10-mm scope with appropriate patient positioning.  Posteriorly a pedunculated 2.5 x 3-cm pleural-based mass was identified on the anterior chest wall.  There were thin adhesions to the pleura, but no invasion of the chest wall that could be identified.  The tumor was very mobile and was on a pedunculated stalk, approximately 1.5 cm.  It was felt that this could be resected without the need of chest wall reconstruction because of the narrow stalk.,Therefore a 2nd port was placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 8th intercostal space in the usual fashion.  Camera was placed through this port.  Laparoscopic scissors were placed through the posterior port, but it was necessary to have another instrument to provide more tension than just gravity.  Therefore because of the need to bring the specimen through the chest wall, a small 3-cm thoracotomy was made, which incorporated the posterior port site.  This was taken down to the subcutaneous tissue with Bovie electrocautery.  Periosteal elevator was used to lift the intercostal muscle off.  The ribs were not spread.  Through this 3-cm incision, both the laparoscopic scissors as well as Prestige graspers could be placed.  Prestige graspers were used to pull the specimen from the chest wall.  Care was taken not to injure the capsule.  The laparoscopic scissors on cautery were used to resect the parietal pleural off of the chest wall.  Care was taken not to transect the stalk.  Specimen came off the chest wall very easily.  There was good hemostasis.,At this point, the EndoCatch bag was placed through the incision.  Specimen was placed in the bag and then removed from the field.  There was good hemostasis.  Camera was removed.  A 24-French chest tube was placed through the anterior port and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  The posterior port site was closed 1st with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion for the intercostal muscle layer, followed by 2-0 closure of the latissimus fascia as well as subdermal suture, 4-0 Monocryl was used for the skin, followed by Steri-Strips and sterile drapes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.cardiovascular / pulmonary, mini thoracotomy, pleural based mass, pleural based nodule, chest wall, mesothelioma focal, pleural, chest, thoracotomy, mesothelioma, laparoscopic, thoracoscopy, "

The risks and perceivable complications of the surgeries were discussed with the patient via a translator as well as nonsurgical treatment options and this was scheduled emergently.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative room where general anesthesia was successfully introduced.  The right ankle was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The tourniquet was applied about the right upper thigh.  An Esmarch tourniquet was used to exsanguinate the ankle.  The tourniquet was insufflated to a pressure 325 mm for approximately 59 minutes.  An approximately 6 inch longitudinal incision was made just over the lateral malleolus.  Care was taken to spare overlying nerves and vessels.  An elevator was used to expose the fracture.  The fracture was freed of old hematoma and reduced with a reducing clamp.  An interfragmentary cortical screw was placed of 28 mm with excellent purchase.  The intraoperative image showed excellent reduction.  A 5-hole semitubular plate was then contoured to the lateral malleolus and fixed with 3 cortical screws proximally and 2 cancellous screws distally.  Excellent stability of fracture was achieved.  Final fluoroscopy showed a reduction to be anatomic in 2 planes.  The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  Deep tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and closed with staples.  Dry sterile dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure, was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.orthopedic, open reduction and internal fixation, esmarch, internal fixation, malleolus fracture, lateral malleolus, tourniquet, orif, fixation, ankle, reduction, fracture, malleolus"

I subsequently spoke to Dr. X and it was decided to admit the patient.,The patient initially stated that he wanted to be observed in the ER and given pain control and fluids and wanted to go home in the morning.  He stated that he has a job interview in the morning.  The resident service did come to evaluate him.  The resident service then spoke to Dr. X and it was decided to admit him on to the Hematology service for control of pain and IV hydration.  He is to be transitioned to p.o. medications about 4 a.m. and hopefully, he can be discharged in time to make his interview tomorrow.,IMPRESSION:  ,Sickle cell crisis.,DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: , Veno-occlusive crisis, and diskitis.nan"
2,"REASON FOR VISIT: , I have been asked to see this 63-year-old man with a dilated cardiomyopathy by Dr. X at ABCD Hospital.  He presents with a chief complaint of heart failure.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , In retrospect, he has had symptoms for the past year of heart failure.  He feels in general ""OK,"" but is stressed and fatigued.  He works hard running 3 companies.  He has noted shortness of breath with exertion and occasional shortness of breath at rest.  There has been some PND, but he sleeps on 1 pillow.  He has no edema now, but has had some mild leg swelling in the past.  There has never been any angina and he denies any palpitations, syncope or near syncope.  When he takes his pulse, he notes some irregularity.  He follows no special diet.  He gets no regular exercise, although he has recently started walking for half an hour a day.  Over the course of the past year, these symptoms have been slowly getting worse.  He gained about 20 pounds over the past year.,There is no prior history of either heart failure or other heart problems.,His past medical history is remarkable for a right inguinal hernia repair done in 1982.  He had trauma to his right thumb.  There is no history of high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus or heart murmur.,On social history, he lives in San Salvador with his wife.  He has a lot of stress in his life.  He does not smoke, but does drink.  He has high school education.,On family history, mother is alive at age 89.  Father died at 72 of heart attack.  He has 2 brothers and 1 sister all of whom are healthy, although the oldest suffered a myocardial infarction.  He has 3 healthy girls and 9 healthy grandchildren.,A complete review of systems was performed and is negative aside from what is mentioned in the history of present illness.,MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily and chlordiazepoxide and clidinium - combination pill at 5 mg/2.5 mg 1 tablet daily for stress.,ALLERGIES: , Denied.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  On my comprehensive cardiovascular examination, he is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 231 pounds.  His blood pressure is 120/70 in each arm seated.  His pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular.  He is breathing 1two times per minute and that is unlabored.  Eyelids are normal.  Pupils are round and reactive to light.  Conjunctivae are clear and sclerae are anicteric.  There is no oral thrush or central cyanosis.  Neck is supple and symmetrical without adenopathy or thyromegaly.  Jugular venous pressure is normal.  Carotids are brisk without bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.  The precordium is quiet.  The rhythm is regular.  The first and second heart sounds are normal.  He does have a fourth heart sound and a soft systolic murmur.  The precordial impulse is enlarged.  Abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  He has no clubbing, cyanosis or peripheral edema.  Distal pulses are normal throughout both arms and both legs.  On neurologic examination, his mentation is normal.  His mood and affect are normal.  He is oriented to person, place, and time.,DATA: , His EKG shows sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy.,A metabolic stress test shows that he was able to exercise for 5 minutes and 20 seconds to 90% of his maximum predicted heart rate.  His peak oxygen consumption was 19.7 mL/kg/min, which is consistent with mild cardiopulmonary disease.,Laboratory data shows his TSH to be 1.33.  His glucose is 97 and creatinine 0.9.  Potassium is 4.3.  He is not anemic.  Urinalysis was normal.,I reviewed his echocardiogram personally.  This shows a dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of 15%.  The left ventricular diastolic dimension is 6.8 cm.  There are no significant valvular abnormalities.,He had a stress thallium.  His heart rate response to stress was appropriate.  The thallium images showed no scintigraphic evidence of stress-induced myocardial ischemia at 91% of his maximum age predicted heart rate.  There is a fixed small sized mild-to-moderate intensity perfusion defect in the distal inferior wall and apex, which may be an old infarct, but certainly does not account for the degree of cardiomyopathy.  We got his post-stress EF to be 33% and the left ventricular cavity appeared to be enlarged.  The total calcium score will put him in the 56 percentile for subjects of the same age, gender, and race/ethnicity.,ASSESSMENTS: , This appears to be a newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy, the etiology of which is uncertain.,PROBLEMS DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.,2.  Dyslipidemia.,PROCEDURES AND IMMUNIZATIONS: , None today.,PLANS: , I started him on an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, and a beta-blocker, carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily.  The dose of these drugs should be up-titrated every 2 weeks to a target dose of lisinopril of 20 mg daily and carvedilol 25 mg twice daily.  In addition, he could benefit from a loop diuretic such as furosemide.  I did not start this as he is planning to go back home to San Salvador tomorrow.  I will leave that up to his local physicians to up-titrate the medications and get him started on some furosemide.,In terms of the dilated cardiomyopathy, there is not much further that needs to be done, except for family screening.  All of his siblings and his children should have an EKG and an echocardiogram to make sure they have not developed the same thing.  There is a strong genetic component of this.,I will see him again in 3 to 6 months, whenever he can make it back here.  He does not need a defibrillator right now and my plan would be to get him on the right doses of the right medications and then recheck an echocardiogram 3 months later.  If his LV function has not improved, he does have New York Heart Association Class II symptoms and so he would benefit from a prophylactic ICD.,Thank you for asking me to participate in his care.,MEDICATION CHANGES:,  See the above.nan"

Chronic renal failure.,3.  Hyperkalemia.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Thrombectomy of the left forearm loop graft.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with sedation.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 5 cc.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  The venous outflow was good.  There was stenosis in the mid-venous limb of the graft.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is an 81-year-old African-American female who presents with an occluded left forearm loop graft.  She was not able to have her dialysis as routine.  Her potassium was dramatically elevated at 7 the initial evening of anticipated surgery.  Both Surgery and Anesthesia thought this would be too risky to do.  Thus, she was given medications to decrease her potassium and a temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed in the femoral vein noted for her to have dialysis that night as well as this morning.  This morning her predialysis potassium was 6, and thus she was scheduled for surgery after her dialysis.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A transverse incision was made at the region of the venous anastomosis of the graft.  Further dissection was carried down to the catheter.  The vein appeared to be soft and without thrombus.  This outflow did not appear to be significantly impaired.  A transverse incision was made with a #11 blade on the venous limb of the graft near the anastomosis.  Next, a thrombectomy was done using a #4 Fogarty catheter.  Some of the clot and thrombus was removed from the venous limb.  The balloon did hang up in the multiple places along the venous limb signifying some degree of stenosis.  Once removing most of the clots from the venous limb prior to removing the plug, dilators were passed down the venous limb also indicating the area of stenosis.  At this point, we felt the patient would benefit from a curettage of the venous limb of the graft.  This was done and subsequent passes with the dilator and the balloon were then very easy and smooth following the curettage.  The Fogarty balloon was then passed beyond the clot and the plug.  The plug was visualized and inspected.  This also gave a good brisk bleeding from the graft.  The patient was heparinized and hep saline solution was injected into the venous limb and the angle vascular clamp was applied to the venous limb.  Attention was directed up to its anastomosis and the vein.  Fogarty balloon and thrombectomy was also performed well enough into this way.  There was good venous back bleeding following this.  The area was checked for any stenosis with the dilators and none was present.  Next, a #6-0 Prolene suture was used in a running fashion to close the graft.  Just prior to tying the suture, the graft was allowed to flush to move any debris or air.  The suture was also checked at that point for augmentation, which was good.  The suture was tied down and the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues and a #4-0 undyed Vicryl was used in a running subcuticular fashion to approximate the skin edges.  Steri-Strips were applied and the patient was taken to recovery in stable condition.  She tolerated the procedure well.  She will be discharged from recovery when stable.  She is to resume her regular dialysis schedule and present for dialysis tomorrow.surgery, thrombosed, hyperkalemia, thrombectomy, forearm loop graft, venous outflow, chronic renal failure, venous limb, loop graft, forearm loop, limb, forearm, graft, venous, anastomosis, stenosis,"
1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Lumbar stenosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Lumbar stenosis and cerebrospinal fluid fistula.,TITLE OF THE OPERATION,1.  Lumbar laminectomy for decompression with foraminotomies L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 microtechniques.,2.  Repair of CSF fistula, microtechniques L5-S1, application of DuraSeal.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is an 82-year-old woman who has about a four-month history now of urinary incontinence and numbness in her legs and hands, and difficulty ambulating.  She was evaluated with an MRI scan, which showed a very high-grade stenosis in her lumbar spine, and subsequent evaluation included a myelogram, which demonstrated cervical stenosis at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 as well as a complete block of the contrast at L4-L5 and no contrast at L5-S1 either and stenosis at L3-L4 and all the way up, but worse at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.  Yesterday, she underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7 and had some improvement of her symptoms and increased strength, even in the recovery room.  She was kept in the ICU because of her age and the need to bring her back to the operating room today for decompressive lumbar laminectomy.  The rationale for putting the surgery is close together that she is normally on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, though she has been cardioverted.  She and her son understand the nature, indications, and risks of the surgery, and agreed to go ahead.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought from the Neuro ICU to the operating room, where general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was rolled in a prone position on the Wilson frame.  The back was prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak, followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  Using the usual anatomical landmarks, linear midline incision was made presumed over L4-L5 and L5-S1.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue, then Bovie electrocautery was used to isolate the spinous processes.  A Kocher clamp was placed in the anterior spinous ligament and this turned out to be L5-S1.  The incision was extended rostrally and deep Gelpi's were inserted to expose the spinous processes and lamina of L3, L4, L5, and S1.  Using the Leksell rongeur, the spinous processes of L4 and L5 were removed completely, and the caudal part of L3.  A high-speed drill was then used to thin the caudal lamina of L3, all of the lamina of L4 and of L5.  Then using various Kerrison punches, I proceeded to perform a laminectomy.  Removing the L5 lamina, there was a dural band attached to the ligamentum flavum and this caused about a 3-mm tear in the dura.  There was CSF leak.  The lamina removal was continued, ligamentum flavum was removed to expose all the dura.  Then using 4-0 Nurolon suture, a running-locking suture was used to close the approximate 3-mm long dural fistula.  There was no CSF leak with Valsalva.,I then continued the laminectomy removing all of the lamina of L5 and of L4, removing the ligamentum flavum between L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1.  Foraminotomies were accomplished bilaterally.  The caudal aspect of the lamina of L3 also was removed.  The dura came up quite nicely.  I explored out along the L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots after completing the foraminotomies, the roots were quite free.  Further more, the thecal sac came up quite nicely.  In order to ensure no CSF leak, we would follow the patient out of the operating room.  The dural closure was covered with a small piece of fat.  This was all then covered with DuraSeal glue.  Gelfoam was placed on top of this, then the muscle was closed with interrupted 0 Ethibond.  The lumbodorsal fascia was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 0 Ethibond in a watertight fashion.  Scarpa's fascia was closed with a running 0 Vicryl, and finally the skin was closed with a running-locking 3-0 nylon.  The wound was blocked with 0.5% plain Marcaine.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Estimated blood loss for the case was about 100 mL.,SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNTS:  Correct.,FINDINGS:  A very tight high-grade stenosis at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.  There were adhesions between the dura and the ligamentum flavum owing to the severity and length of the stenosis.,The patient tolerated the procedure well with stable vitals throughout.surgery, microtechniques, fistula, duraseal, foraminotomies, lumbar, stenosis, cerebrospinal, lumbar laminectomy, ligamentum flavum, csf, laminectomy, lamina,"

After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the McIvor mouth gag was placed in the oral cavity and a tongue depressor applied.  Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction.  The nasopharynx was inspected with the laryngeal mirror.,Attention was then directed to the right tonsil.  The anterior tonsillar pillar was infiltrated with 1.5 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, as was the left tonsillar pillar.  The right tonsil was grasped with the tenaculum and retracted out of its fossa.  The anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with the #12 knife blade.  The plica semilunaris was incised with the Metzenbaum scissors.  Using the Metzenbaum scissors and the Fisher knife, the tonsil was dissected free of its fossa onto an inferior pedicle around which the tonsillar snare was placed and applied.  The tonsil was removed from the fossa and the fossa packed with a cherry gauze sponge as previously described.  By a similar procedure, the opposite tonsillectomy was performed and the fossa was packed.,Attention was re-directed to the right tonsil.  The pack was removed and bleeding was controlled with the suction Bovie unit.  Bleeding was then similarly controlled in the left tonsillar fossa and the nasopharynx after removal of the packs.  The catheters were then removed.  The nasal passages and oropharynx were suctioned free of debris.  The procedure was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.ent - otolaryngology, tongue, palate, mcivor mouth gag, anterior tonsillar, metzenbaum scissors, oral cavity, tonsillar pillar, tonsillectomy, metzenbaum, tonsillitis, pillar, tonsillar, fossa "

1,"PROCEDURE: , Circumcision.,Signed informed consent was obtained and the procedure explained.,The child was placed in a Circumstraint board and restrained in the usual fashion.  The area of the penis and scrotum were prepared with povidone iodine solution.  The area was draped with sterile drapes, and the remainder of the procedure was done with sterile procedure.  A dorsal penile block was done using 2 injections of 0.3 cc each, 1% plain lidocaine.  A dorsal slit was made, and the prepuce was dissected away from the glans penis.  A ** Gomco clamp was properly placed for 5 minutes.  During this time, the foreskin was sharply excised using a #10 blade.  With removal of the clamp, there was a good cosmetic outcome and no bleeding.  The child appeared to tolerate the procedure well.

4,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,Followup cervical spinal stenosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis.  I have last seen her on 06/19/07.  Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects.,I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI.,She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.  She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain.  The right hand weakness continues.  She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her.,She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms.,She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.  No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath.,FINDINGS:  ,On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x3.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Afebrile to touch.,She ambulates with a normal gait.,Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion.,Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 3 plus.  Hoffman sign normal bilaterally.,Lower extremity strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups.  Patellar reflex is 3 plus.  No clonus.,Cervical spine radiographs dated 06/21/07 are reviewed.,They demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease.  There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views.,Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6.  These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level.  Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7.  This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5.,Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness.,I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options.,I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions.,The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done.  I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness.,She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention.,I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model.,I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain.  She understands.,I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient's relatively young age.  Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies.,I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty.  She understands.,She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon.  She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then.  Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07.  She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process.nan"

Hemorrhoids.,PROCEDURE:  ,Total colonoscopy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient is a 60-year-old of Dr. ABC's being evaluated for the above.  The patient also apparently had an x-ray done at the Hospital and it showed a dark spot, and because of this, a colonoscopy was felt to be needed.  She was prepped the night before and on the morning of the test with oral Fleet's, brought to the second floor and sedated with a total of 50 mg of Demerol and 3.75 mg of Versed IV push.  Digital rectal exam was done, unremarkable.  At that point, the Pentax video colonoscope was inserted.  The rectal vault appeared normal.  The sigmoid showed diverticula throughout, mild to moderate in nature.  The scope was then passed through the descending and transverse colon over to the hepatic flexure area and then the anastomosis site was visualized.  The scope was passed a short distance up the ileum, which appeared normal.  The scope was then withdrawn through the transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectal vault area.  The scope was then retroflexed, and anal verge visualized showed some hemorrhoids.  The scope was then removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,Repeat colonoscopy in three years.surgery, partial colon resection, diverticulosis, colon polyps, rectal vault, colonoscopy, polyps, hemorrhoids, sigmoid"

I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic.  He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ,When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side.  His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration.  They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially.  I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels.  I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation.  If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. ,Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. ,Sincerely yours,urology, differential function, diuretic renal scan, abdominal pain, renal scan, pediatric urology, "

1,"EXAM: , CT of abdomen with and without contrast.  CT-guided needle placement biopsy.,HISTORY: , Left renal mass.,TECHNIQUE: , Pre and postcontrast enhanced images were acquired through the kidneys.,FINDINGS: , Comparison made to the prior MRI.  There is re-demonstration of multiple bilateral cystic renal lesions.  Several of these demonstrate high attenuation in the precontrast phase of the exam suggesting that they are hemorrhagic cysts.  There was however one cyst seen in the lower pole of the left kidney, which demonstrated apparent enhancement from 30 to 70 Hounsfield units post contrast administration.  This measured approximately 1.4 x 1.3 cm to the exophytic half of the lower pole.  No other enhancing renal masses were seen.  The visualized liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands were unremarkable.  There are changes of cholecystectomy.  Mild prominence of the common bile duct is likely secondary to cholecystectomy.  There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy, masses, fluid collection, or ascites.,Lung bases are clear.  No acute bony pathology was noted.,IMPRESSION: , Solitary apparently enhancing left renal mass in the lower pole as described.  Renal cell carcinoma cannot be excluded.,CT-GUIDED NEEDLE BIOPSY, LEFT KIDNEY MASS: , Following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, the patient wished to proceed with CT-guided biopsy of left renal lesion.  The patient was placed in the decubitus position.  The region overlying the left renal mass of note was marked.  Area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with approximately 8 mL of 1% lidocaine with bicarbonate.  The Versed and fentanyl were given to achieve conscious sedation.  Utilizing an 18 x 15 gauge coaxial system, 3 core biopsies were obtained through the mass in question, and sent to pathology for analysis.  Following procedure, scans through the region demonstrate a small subcutaneous hematoma in the region of the superficial anesthesia.  No perinephric fluid/hematoma was identified.  The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.,IMPRESSION: , Three core biopsies through the region of the left renal tumor as described.surgery, ct, ct-guided, ct-guided biopsy, hounsfield units, mri, abdomen, biopsy, cholecystectomy, contrast, contrast administration, decubitus position, images, needle, postcontrast, renal lesions, renal mass, renal tumor, with and without, ct guided needle placement, ct of abdomen, needle placement, lower pole, ct guided, renal"

Gastrointestinal bleed and chronic inflammation of the mesentery of unknown etiology.,BRIEF H&P AND HOSPITAL COURSE: , This patient is a 56-year-old male, a patient of Dr. X with 25-pack-year history, also a history of diabetes type 2, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hemorrhoids, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a left lower lobe calcified granuloma that apparently is stable at this time.  This patient presented with periumbilical abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past 3 days and four to five watery bowel movements a day with symptoms progressively getting worse.  The patient was admitted into the ER and had trop x1 done, which was negative and ECG showed to be of normal sinus rhythm.,Lab findings initially presented with a hemoglobin of 13.1, hematocrit of 38.6 with no elevation of white count.  Upon discharge, his hemoglobin and hematocrit stayed at 10.9 and 31.3 and he was still having stool guaiac positive blood, and a stool study was done which showed few white blood cells, negative for Clostridium difficile and moderate amount of occult blood and moderate amount of RBCs.  The patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea did resolve during his hospital course.  Was placed on IV fluids initially and on hospital day #2 fluids were discontinued and was started on clear liquid diet and diet was advanced slowly, and the patient was able to tolerate p.o. well.  The patient also denied any abdominal pain upon day of discharge.  The patient was also started on prednisone as per GI recommendations.  He was started on 60 mg p.o.  Amylase and lipase were also done which were normal and LDH and CRP was also done which are also normal and LFTs were done which were also normal as well.,PLAN: , The plan is to discharge the patient home.  He can resume his home medications of Prandin, Actos, Lipitor, Glucophage, Benicar, and Advair.  We will also start him on a tapered dose of prednisone for 4 weeks.  We will start him on 15 mg p.o. for seven days.  Then, week #2, we will start him on 40 mg for 1 week.  Then, week #3, we will start him on 30 mg for 1 week, and then, 20 mg for 1 week, and then finally we will stop.  He was instructed to take tapered dose of prednisone for 4 weeks as per the GI recommendations.gastroenterology, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleed, mesentery, hemoglobin, hematocrit, gastrointestinal, periumbilical, gastroenteritis, hemorrhoids"
3,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is well known to me for a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss from colitis.  We corrected her hematocrit last year with intravenous (IV) iron.  Ultimately, she had a total proctocolectomy done on 03/14/2007 to treat her colitis.  Her course has been very complicated since then with needing multiple surgeries for removal of hematoma.  This is partly because she was on anticoagulation for a right arm deep venous thrombosis (DVT) she had early this year, complicated by septic phlebitis.,Chart was reviewed, and I will not reiterate her complex history.,I am asked to see the patient again because of concerns for coagulopathy.,She had surgery again last month to evacuate a pelvic hematoma, and was found to have vancomycin resistant enterococcus, for which she is on multiple antibiotics and followed by infectious disease now.,She is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as well.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Labs today showed a white blood count of 7.9, hemoglobin 11.0, hematocrit 32.8, and platelets 1,121,000.  MCV is 89.  Her platelets have been elevated for at least the past week, with counts initially at the 600,000 to 700,000 range and in the last couple of day rising above 1,000,000.  Her hematocrit has been essentially stable for the past month or so.  White blood count has improved.,PT has been markedly elevated and today is 44.9 with an INR of 5.0.  This is despite stopping Coumadin on 05/31/2007, and with administration of vitamin K via the TPN, as well as additional doses IV.  The PT is slightly improved over the last few days, being high at 65.0 with an INR of 7.3 yesterday.,PTT has not been checked since 05/18/2007 and was normal then at 28.,LFTs have been elevated.  ALT is 100, AST 57, GGT 226, alkaline phosphatase 505, albumin low at 3.3, uric acid high at 4.9, bilirubin normal, LDH normal, and pre-albumin low at 16.  Creatinine is at 1.5, with an estimated creatinine clearance low at 41.7.  Other electrolytes are fairly normal.,B12 was assessed on 05/19/2007 and was normal at 941.  Folic acid was normal.  Iron saturation has not been checked since March, and was normal then.  Ferritin has not been checked in a couple of months.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Erythropoietin 45,000 units every week, started 05/16/2007.  She is on heparin flushes, loperamide, niacin, pantoprazole, Diovan, Afrin nasal spray, caspofungin, daptomycin, Ertapenem, fentanyl or morphine p.r.n. pain, and Compazine or Zofran p.r.n. nausea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ,GENERAL:  She is alert, and frustrated with her prolonged hospital stay.  She notes that she had epistaxis a few days ago, requiring nasal packing and fortunately that had resolved now.,VITAL SIGNS:  Today, temperature is 98.5, pulse 99, respirations 16, blood pressure 105/65, and pulse is 95.  She is not requiring oxygen.,SKIN:  No significant ecchymoses are noted.,ABDOMEN:  Ileostomy is in place, with greenish black liquid output.  Midline surgical scar has healed well, with a dressing in place in the middle, with no bleeding noted.,EXTREMITIES:  She has no peripheral edema.,CARDIAC:  Regular rate.,LYMPHATICS:  No adenopathy is noted.,LUNGS:  Clear bilaterally.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  Markedly elevated PT/INR despite stopping Coumadin and administering vitamin K.  I will check mixing studies to see if she has deficiency, which could be due to poor production given her elevated LFTs, decreased albumin, and decreased pre-albumin.,It is possible that she has an inhibitor, which would have to be an acquired inhibitor, generally presenting with an elevated PTT and not PT.  I will check a PTT and check mixing studies if that is prolonged.  It is doubtful that she has a lupus anticoagulant since she has been presenting with bleeding symptoms rather than clotting.  I agree with continuing off of anticoagulation for now.,She has markedly elevated platelet count.  I suspect this is likely reactive to infection, and not from a new myeloproliferative disorder.,Anemia has been stable, and is multifactorial.  Given her decreased creatinine clearance, I agree with erythropoietin support.  She was iron deficient last year, and with her multiple surgeries and poor p.o. intake, may have become iron deficient again.  She has had part of her small bowel removed, so there may be a component of poor absorption as well.  If she is iron deficient, this may contribute also to her elevated platelet counts.  I will check a ferritin.  This may be difficult to interpret because of inflammation.  If it is decreased, plan will be to add iron supplementation intravenously.  If it is elevated, we could consider a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate her iron stores, and also assess her myelopoiesis given the markedly elevated platelet counts.,She needs continued treatment as you are for her infections.,I will discuss the case with Dr. X as well since there is a question as to whether she might need additional surgery.  She is not a surgical candidate now with her elevated PT/INR.nan"
3,"SUBJECTIVE: , I am following the patient today for immune thrombocytopenia.  Her platelets fell to 10 on 01/09/07 and shortly after learning of that result, I increased her prednisone to 60 mg a day.  Repeat on 01/16/07 revealed platelets up at 43.  No bleeding problems have been noted.  I have spoken with her hematologist who recommends at this point we decrease her prednisone to 40 mg for 3 days and then go down to 20 mg a day.  The patient had been on 20 mg every other day at least for a while, and her platelets hovered at least above 20 or so.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Vitals:  As in chart.  The patient is alert, pleasant, and cooperative.  She is in no apparent distress.  The petechial areas on her legs have resolved.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Patient with improvement of her platelet count on burst of prednisone.  We will decrease her prednisone to 40 mg for 3 days, then go down to 20 mg a day.  Basically thereafter, over time, I may try to sneak it back a little bit further.  She is on medicines for osteoporosis including bisphosphonate and calcium with vitamin D.

The occipital area was shaven bilaterally and then the areas of the prior scalp incisions were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine after routine prepping and draping.  Both U-shaped scalp incisions were opened exposing both the left and the right ventricular catheters as well as the old low pressure reservoir, which might have been leading to the coaptation of the ventricles.  The patient also had a right subtemporal depression, which was full preoperatively.  The entire old apparatus was dissected out.  We then cut both the ventricular catheters and secured them with sutures so that __________ could be inserted.  They were both inspected.  No definite debris were seen.  After removing the ventricular catheters, the old tracts were inspected and we could see where there was coaptation of the ventricles against the ventricular catheter.  On the right side, we elected to insert the Portnoy ventricular catheter and on the left a new Bactiseal catheter was inserted underneath the corpus callosum in a different location.  The old valve was dissected out and the proGAV valve with a 2-0 shunt assist was inserted and secured with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The proGAV valve was then connected to a Bactiseal distal tubing, which was looped in a cephalad way and then curved towards the left burr hole site and then the Portnoy catheter on the right was secured with a right-angled sleeve and then interposed between it and the left burr hole site with a flushing reservoir.  All connections secured with 2-0 Ethibond suture and a small piece of Bactiseal tubing between the flushing reservoir and the connector, which secured the left Bactiseal tubing to the two other Bactiseal tubings one being the distal Bactiseal tubing going towards the proGAV valve, which was set to an opening pressure of 8 and the other one being the Bactiseal tubing, which was going towards the flushing reservoir.,All the wounds were irrigated out with bacitracin and then closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.

2,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Please evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a very pleasant 57-year old white female, a native of Cuba, being seen for evaluation and treatment of sores in her mouth that she has had for the last 10-12 days.  The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.  ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, Reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosions on the areas today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.  ,IMPRESSION: , Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.  ,I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  ,RECOMMENDED THERAPY: ,I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients’ skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.  ,Thank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.

4,"HISTORY:,  The patient is 14 months old, comes in with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing.  Difficulty breathing began last night.  He was taken to Emergency Department where he got some Xopenex, given a prescription for amoxicillin and discharged home.  They were home for about an hour when he began to get worse and they drove here to Children's Hospital.  He has a history of reactive airway disease.  He has been seen here twice in the last month on 10/04/2007 and 10/20/2007, both times with some wheezing.  He was diagnosed with pneumonia back on 06/12/2007 here in the Emergency Department but was not admitted at that time.  He has been on albuterol off and on over that period.  He has had fever overnight.  No vomiting, no diarrhea.  Increased work of breathing with retractions and audible wheezes noted and thus brought to the Emergency Department.  Normal urine output.  No rashes have been seen.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , As noted above.  No hospitalizations, surgeries, allergies.,MEDICATIONS: , Xopenex.,IMMUNIZATIONS:,  Up-to-date.,BIRTH HISTORY:,  The child was full term, no complications, home with mom.  No surgeries.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , No smokers or pets in the home.  No ill contacts, no travel, no change in living condition.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Ten are asked, all are negative, except as noted above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temp 37.1, pulse 158, respiratory rate 48, 84% on room air indicating hypoxia.,GENERAL:  The child is awake, alert, in moderate respiratory distress.,HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  The TMs are clear.  The nares show some dry secretions.  Audible congestion and wheezing is noted.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Throat is clear.  No oral lesions noted.,NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or masses.  Trachea is midline.,LUNGS:  Show inspiratory and expiratory wheezes in all fields.  Audible wheezes are noted.  There are intercostal and subcostal retractions and suprasternal muscle use is noted.,HEART:  Shows tachycardia.  Regular rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmur.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  No guarding.  No rebound.  No hepatosplenomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  Capillary refill is brisk.  Good distal pulses.,NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Moves all 4 extremities equally and normally.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The child has an IV placed.  I felt the child was dehydrated on examination.  We gave 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline over one hour.  The child was given Solu-Medrol 2 mg/kg IV.  He was initially started on unit dose albuterol and Atrovent but high-dose albuterol for continuous nebulization was ordered.,A portable chest x-ray was done showing significant peribronchial thickening bilaterally.  Normal heart size.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No evidence of focal pneumonia.  After 3 unit dose of albuterol/Atrovent breathing treatments, there was much better air exchange bilaterally but still with inspiratory/expiratory wheezes and high-dose continuous albuterol was started at that time.  The child was monitored closely while on high-dose albuterol and slowly showed improvement resulting in only expiratory wheezes after one hour.  The child's pulse ox on breathing treatments with 100% oxygen was 100%.  Respiratory rate remained about 40 to 44 breaths per minute indicating tachypnea.  The child's color improved with oxygen therapy, and the capillary refill was always less than 2 seconds.,The child has failed outpatient therapy at this time.  After 90 minutes of continuous albuterol treatment, the child still has expiratory wheezes throughout.  After I removed the oxygen, the pulse ox was down at 91% indicating hypoxia.  The child has a normal level of alertness; however, has not had any vomiting here.  I spoke with Dr. X, on call for hospitalist service.  She has come down and evaluated the patient.  We both feel that since this child had two ER visits this last month, one previous ER visit within the last 5 hours, we should admit the child for continued albuterol treatments, IV steroids, and asthma teaching for the family.  The child is admitted in a stable condition.,DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,Ruled out pneumothorax, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, croup.,TIME SPENT:  ,Critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient.,IMPRESSION:  ,Status asthmaticus, hypoxia.,PLAN:  ,Admitted to Pediatrics.nan"
4,"TITLE OF OPERATION:  ,1.  Incision and drainage with extensive debridement, left shoulder.,2.  Removal total shoulder arthroplasty (uncemented humeral Biomet component; cemented glenoid component).,3.  Implantation of antibiotic beads, left shoulder.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient was seen multiple times preoperatively and found to have findings consistent with a chronic and indolent infections.  Risks and benefits have been discussed with him and his family at length including but not exclusive of continued infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, incomplete return of function, fractures, loss of bone, medical complications, surgical complications, transfusion related complications, etc.  The patient understood and wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Presumed infection, left total shoulder arthroplasty.,POSTOP DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Deep extensive infection, left total shoulder arthroplasty.,2.  Biceps tenosynovitis.,3.  Massive rotator cuff tear in left shoulder (full thickness subscapularis tendon rupture 3 cm x 4 cm; supraspinatus tendon rupture 3 cm x 3 cm; infraspinatus tear 2 cm x 2 cm).,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was anesthetized in the supine position, a Foley catheter was placed in his bladder.  He was then placed Beach chair position and all bony prominences were well padded.  Pillows were placed around his knees to protect his sciatic nerve.  He was brought to the side of the table and secured with towels and tape.  The head was placed in neutral position with no lateral bending or extension to protect the brachioplexus from any stretch.  Left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Unfortunately, preoperative antibiotics were given prior to the procedure.  This occurred due to lack of communication between the surgical staff and the anesthesia staff.  The patient's extremity, however, was prepped a second time with a chlorhexidine prep after he had been draped.  Also, Ioban bandages were placed securely to the skin to prevent any further introduction of infection into his shoulder.,Deltopectoral incision was then made.  The patient's had a cephalic vein, it was identified and protected throughout the case.  It was retracted laterally and once this has been completed, the deltopectoral interval was developed as carefully as possible.  The patient did have significant scar from this point on and did bleed from many surfaces throughout the case.  As a result, he was transfused 1 unit postoperatively.  He did not have any problems during the case except for one small drop of blood pressure.  However this was due primarily because of the extensive scarring of his proximal humerus.  He had scar between the anterior capsular structures and the conjoint tendon.  Also there was significant scar between the deltoid and the proximal humerus.  The deltoid was very carefully and tediously removed from the proximal humerus in order not to damage the axillary nerve.  Once the plane between the deltoid and underlying tissue was found, the proximal humerus was discovered to have a large defect, approximately 4 x 3.  This was covered by rimmed fibrous tissue which was fairly compressible, which felt to be purulent, however, when the needle was stuck into this area, there was no return of fluid.  As a result, this was finally opened and found to have fibrinous exudates which appeared to be old congealed, purulent material.  There was some suggestion of a synovitis type reaction also inside this cystic area.  This was all debrided but was found to track all the way into the proximal humerus from the lateral femoral component and also tracked posteriorly through and around the posterior cortex of the proximal humerus indicating that the infraspinatus probably had some tearing and detachment.  This later proved to be the case and infraspinatus did indeed have a tear 2 cm x 2 cm.  All of the mucinous material and fibrinous material was removed from the proximal humerus.  This was fairly extensive debridement.  All of this was sent to pathology and also sent for culture and sensitivity.  It should be noted that Gram stain became as multiple white blood cells but no organism seen.  The pathology came back as fibrinous material with multiple white cells, also with signs of chronic inflammation consistent with an infection.,Attention was then directed towards the anterior structures to gain access to the joint so that we could dislocate the prosthesis and remove it.  There was also cystic area in the anterior aspect of the shoulder which was fairly fibrinous.  This was also removed.  Once this was removed, though the capsule was found to be very thin, there was essentially no subscapularis tendon whatsoever.  It should also noted the patient's proximal humerus was subluxed superiorly so that there was no supraspinatus tendon present whatsoever.  As a result, the biceps tendon was finally identified just below the pectoralis tendon insertion.  The upper 1 or 2 cm of the pectoralis insertion was released in order to find the biceps.  It was tracked proximally and transverse ligament released.  The biceps tendon was flat and somewhat erythematous.  As a result, it released and tagged with an 0 Vicryl suture.  It was later tenodesed to the conjoint tendon using 2-0 Prolene sutures.  The joint was then entered and noted significant synovitis throughout the entire glenoid.  This was all very carefully removed using a rongeur and sharp dissection.,Next, the humeral component was removed and this was done by attempting to remove it with the slap hammer and device which comes with the Biomet set.  Unfortunately, this device would not hold the proximal humerus and we could not get the component to release.  As a result, bone contact of the metal proximally was released using a straight osteotome.  Once this was completed, another attempt was made to remove the prosthesis but this only resulted in fracture of the proximal humerus through the areas of erosion of the infection and once this has been completed, we abandoned use of that particular device and using a __________ , we were able to hit the prosthesis lip from beneath and essentially remove it.  There was no cement.  There was exudate within the canal which was removed using a curette.,Using fluoroscopy, sequential reamers were placed to a size of 11 distally down the shaft to remove the exudate.  This was also thoroughly irrigated with irrigation antibiotic, and impregnated irrigation to decrease any risk of infection.  It should be noted that the reaming was done fluoroscopically to make sure that there was no penetration of the canal at any point.,The attention was then directed to the glenoid.  The glenoid component was very carefully dissected free and found to be very loose.  It was essentially removed with digital dissection.  There was no remaining cement in the cavity itself.  The patient's glenoid was very carefully debrided.  The glenoid itself was found to be very cup shaped with significant amount of bone loss in the central portion of the canal itself.  This was debrided using rongeurs and curette until there was no purulent exudate present anywhere in the glenoid itself.,Next, the entire wound was irrigated thoroughly with 9 liters of antibiotic impregnated irrigation.  Rather than place a spacer, it was elected to use antiobiotic beads.  This was with antibiotic impregnated cement with one package with 3 gram of vancomycin.  These beads were then connected using Prolene and placed into the glenoid cavity itself, also some were placed in the greater tuberosity region.  These three did not have a Prolene attached to them.  The ones placed down the canal did have a Prolene used as did the ones placed in the cavity of the glenoid itself.,The biceps tendon was then tenodesed under tension to the conjoint tendon.  There was essentially no capsule left purely to close over the proximal humerus.  It was electively the proximal humerus.  A portion of bone intact because it did have some bleeding surfaces.  Deltopectoral was then closed with 0-Vicryl sutures, the deep subcutaneous tissues with 0-Vicryl sutures, superficial subcutaneous tissues with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin was closed with staples.  A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and shoulder immobilizer.  The patient was sent to recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.,It should be noted that __________ is being requested for this case.  This was a significantly scarred patient which required extra dissection and attention.  Even though this was a standard revision case due to infection, there was a significant more decision making and technical challenges in this case and this was present for typical revision case.  Similarly, this case took approximately 30 to 40% more length of time due to bleeding and the attention to hemostasis.  The blood loss and operative findings indicates that this case was at least 30 to 40% more challenging than a standard total shoulder or revision case.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and recurrent biliary colic.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Severe cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and morbid obesity.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED: , Laparoscopy, laparotomy, cholecystectomy with operative cholangiogram, choledocholithotomy with operative choledochoscopy and T-tube drainage of the common bile duct.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS: , This is a 63-year-old white male patient with multiple medical problems including hypertension, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease, and the patient is on hemodialysis, who has had recurrent episodes of epigastric right upper quadrant pain.  The patient was found to have cholelithiasis on last admission.  He was being worked up for this including cardiac clearance.  However, in the interim, he returned again with another episode of same pain.  The patient had a HIDA scan done yesterday, which shows nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction.  Because of these, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was advised with cholangiogram.  Possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure was also explained to the patient.  The procedure, indications, risks, and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia.  The entire abdomen was prepped and draped.  A small transverse incision was made about 2-1/2 inches above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia.  The patient has a rather long torso.  Fascia was opened vertically and stay sutures were placed in the fascia.  Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.  Hasson cannula was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it was insufflated with CO2.  Laparoscopic camera was inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg and rotated to the left.  An 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region.  Slowly, the dissection was carried out in the right subhepatic area.  Initially, I was able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver.  Then, some inflammatory changes were noted with some fatty necrosis type of changes and it was not quite clear whether this was part of the gallbladder or it was just pericholecystic infection/inflammation.  The visualization was extremely difficult because of the patient's obesity and a lot of fat intra-abdominally, although his abdominal wall is not that thick.  After evaluating this for a little while, we decided that there was no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy.  The trocars were removed.,A right subcostal incision was made and peritoneal cavity was entered.  A Bookwalter retractor was put in place.  The dissection was then carried out on the undersurface of the liver.  Eventually, the gallbladder was identified, which was markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it.  Dissection was further carried down to what was felt to be the common bile duct, which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size.  The duodenum was kocherized.  The gallbladder was partly intrahepatic.  Because of this, I decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem.  The inferior wall of the gallbladder was opened and two large stones, one was about 3 cm long and another one about 1.5 x 2 cm long, were taken out of the gallbladder.,It was difficult to tell where the cystic duct was.  Eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder, I did find the cystic duct, which was relatively very short.  Intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done using C-arm fluoroscopy.  This showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone.  At this time, a decision was made to proceed with common duct exploration.  The common duct was opened between stay sutures of 4-0 Vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out.  After some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver, the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct.  So, it was about a 1-cm size stone, which was removed.  Following this, a 10-French red rubber catheter was passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously.  No further stones were obtained.  The catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater.  At this point, a choledochoscope was inserted and proximally, I did not see any evidence of any common duct stones or proximally into the biliary tree.  However, a stone was found distally still floating around.  This was removed with stone forceps.  The bile ducts were irrigated again.  No further stones were removed.  A 16-French T-tube was then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct was repaired around the T-tube using 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures obtaining watertight closure.  A completion T-tube cholangiogram was done at this time, which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct, although externally, I was unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area.  Because of this, the T-tube was removed, and I passed the choledochoscope proximally again, and I was unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area.  I felt at this time this was most likely an impression from the outside, which was still left over a gallbladder where the stone was stuck and it was impressing on the bile duct.  The bile duct lumen was widely open.  T-tube was again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion T-tube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time.  The cystic duct opening through which I had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram, this was closed with a figure-of-eight suture of 2-0 Vicryl, and this was actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this area.,The remaining gallbladder bed, which was left in situ, was cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining.  Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution.  Hemostasis was good.  A 10-mm Jackson-Pratt drain was left in the foramen of Winslow and brought out through the lateral 5-mm port site.  The T-tube was brought out through the middle 5-mm port site, which was just above the incision.  Abdominal incision was then closed in layers using 0 Vicryl running suture for the peritoneal layer and #1 Novafil running suture for the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl running sutures in two layers.  Subfascial and subcutaneous tissues were injected with a total of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine for postoperative pain control.  The umbilical incision was closed with 0 Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures for the fascia, 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues, and staples for the skin.

There was a great deal of inflammatory reaction around the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was slightly larger.  There was a stone impacted in the cystic duct with the gallbladder.  The gallbladder contained numerous stones which were small.  With the stone impacted in the cystic duct, it was felt that probably none were within the common duct.  Other than rather marked obesity, no other significant findings were noted on limited exploration of the abdomen.,PROCEDURE:,  Under general anesthesia after routine prepping and draping, the abdomen was insufflated with the Veress needle, and the standard four trocars were inserted uneventfully.  Inspection was made for any entry problems, and none were encountered.,After limited exploration, the gallbladder was then retracted superiorly and laterally, and the cystic duct was dissected out.  This was done with some difficulty due to the fibrosis around the cystic duct, but care was taken to avoid injury to the duct and to the common duct.  In this manner, the cystic duct and cystic artery were dissected out.  Care was taken to be sure that the duct that was identified went into the gallbladder and was the cystic duct.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were then doubly clipped and divided, taking care to avoid injury to the common duct.  The gallbladder was then dissected free from the gallbladder bed.  Again, the gallbladder was somewhat adherent to the gallbladder bed due to previous inflammatory reaction.  The gallbladder was dissected free from the gallbladder bed utilizing the endo shears and the cautery to control bleeding.  The gallbladder was extracted through the operating trocar site, and the trocar was reinserted.  Inspection was made of the gallbladder bed.  One or two bleeding areas were fulgurated, and bleeding was well controlled.surgery, cholelithiasis chronic, inflammatory reaction, cystic artery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, common duct, chronic cholecystitis, gallbladder bed, cystic duct, cystic, gallbladder, duct, inflammatory"
2,"HYPERFRACTIONATION,This patient is to undergo a course of hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of known malignancy.  The radiotherapy will be given in a hyperfractionated fraction (decreased dose per fraction but 2 fractions delivered daily separated by a period of at least 6 hours).  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiologic principles that make this type of therapy more effective in rapidly growing, previously irradiated or poorly oxygenated tumors.  The dose per fraction and the total dose are calculated by me, and this is individualized for each patient according to radiobiologic principles.,During the hyperfractionated radiotherapy, the chance of severe acute side effects is increased, so the patient will be followed more intensively for the development of any side effects and treatment instituted accordingly.radiology, irradiated, oxygenated, tumors, malignancy, radiobiologic, hyperfractionation, hyperfractionated, radiotherapyNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

4,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: , Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,  Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:,  None.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008.  Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.  Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,2.  Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,3.  Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008).,4.

She also has a septal deviation mid posterior to the left compromising greater than 70% of her nasal airway.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the skin was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the region of the anterior portion of the nasal septum.  Approximately 10 cc total was used.,A #15 blade and the Freer elevator were used to help make a standard hemitransfixion incision.  A mucoperichondrial flap was carefully elevated, and the junction with the cartilaginous bony septum was separated with the Freer elevator.  The bony deflection was removed using Jansen-Middleton forceps.  The cartilaginous deflection was created by freeing up the inferior attachments to the cartilaginous septum, placing it more on the midline maxillary crest.  The initial incision was placed in its anatomical position and secured with a 4-0 nylon suture for stabilization effect.,Attention then was directed toward the left side.  Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected in the region of the anterior portion of the left middle turbinate and uncinate process and polyps.  Approximately 10 cc total was used.  The polyps were removed using the Richards essential shaver to help identify the middle turbinate and uncinate process better.  The uncinate process was removed systematically superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting forceps.  Next, the maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting forceps and showed polypoid accumulation in the mucosal disease on its opening site.  The sinus linings were edematous but did not have any polyps in the inferior, lateral, or superior aspects.,The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were entered primarily and dissected with the Richards essential shaver followed by the use of a 30-degree endoscope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral dissection.  Bright mucosal disease and small polypoid accumulations were noted through the sinuses also.  The inferior turbinates had some polypoid changes on them also and showed marked mucosal irritation and hypertrophy.  The mucosal polypoid accumulations were cleared using the Richards essential shaver.  The turbinate was partially resected from mucosally but with good shape to it.  It was not desirable to remove it in its entirety.  Any obvious bleeding points along the edge were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.,The same procedure and findings were noted on the right side with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine injected into the anterior portion of the right middle turbinate, polyps, and uncinate process; 10 cc total were used.  The polyps were removed.  The Richards essential shaver was used to allow better exposure of the uncinate process.  The uncinate process was removed superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting side-biting forceps.,Next, a maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting and side-biting forceps and showed all plate accumulations there also.  The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were then entered primarily and dissected with Richards essential shaver followed by the use of the 30-degree scope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral resection.  The inferior turbinates showed mucosal disease, polypoid accumulations, and changes.  These were removed using the Richards essential shaver followed by a submucosal resection of the hypertrophied portion of the turbinate.,Any obvious bleeding points were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.  A thorough irrigation was then carried out in the nasal cavity, and Gelfilm packing was used to coat the linings in the middle meatal regions.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.nan"

After this had been completed, a #15 blade was used to make small stab wounds in the lateral hips, the pubic area, and upper edge of the umbilicus.  Through these small incisions, a cannula was used to infiltrate lactated Ringers with 1000 cc was infiltrated initially into the abdomen.  A 3 and 4-mm cannulas were then used to carry out the liposuction of the abdomen removing a total of 1100 cc of aspirate, which was mostly fat, little fluid, and blood.  Attention was then directed to the thighs both inner and outer.  A total of 1000 cc was infiltrated in both lateral thighs only about 50 cc in the medial thighs.  After this had been completed, 3 and 4-mm cannulas were used to suction 650 cc from each side, approximately 50 cc in the inner thigh and 600 on each lateral thigh.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  All of this aspirate was mostly fat with little fluid and very little blood.  Wounds were cleaned and steri-stripped and dressing of ABD pads and ***** was then applied.

1,"PROCEDURE: , Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and colonoscopy with biopsy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , A 17-year-old with history of 40-pound weight loss, abdominal pain, status post appendectomy with recurrent abscess formation and drainage.  Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.  It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall.  CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease.  Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease.,MEDICATIONS:  ,General anesthesia.,INSTRUMENT:,  Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FINDINGS: , With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia.  The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors.  It appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  Rugal folds were flattened completely.  There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach.  The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology.  Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing.  Excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.,The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy.  Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge.  The colonic clean out was excellent.  The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum.  The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm.  No fistulas were noted in the colon.  Excess air was evacuated from the colon.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.,IMPRESSION: , Normal esophagus and duodenum.  There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve.  All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease.,PLAN:  ,Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily.  Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results.  If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion.  We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy.  Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate.  We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula.  He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy.  If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy.surgery, olympus gif-160, pcf-160, endoscopy, crohn's disease, aphthous ulcers, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscope, esophagus, duodenum, mucosal, stomach, biopsies, colonoscopy"

2,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , ""I want my colostomy reversed."",HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mr. A is a pleasant 43-year-old African-American male who presents to our clinic for a colostomy reversal as well as repair of an incisional hernia.  The patient states that in November 2007, he presented to High Point Regional Hospital with sharp left lower quadrant pain and was emergently taken to Surgery where he woke up with a ""bag.""  According to some notes that were faxed to our office from the surgeon in High Point who performed his initial surgery, Dr. X, the patient had diverticulitis with perforated sigmoid colon, and underwent a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch.  The patient was unaware of his diagnosis; therefore, we discussed that with him today in clinic.  The patient also complains of the development of an incisional hernia since his surgery in November.  He was seen back by Dr. X in April 2008 and hopes that Dr. X may reverse his colostomy and repair his hernia since he did his initial surgery, but because the patient has lost his job and has no insurance, he was referred to our clinic by Dr. X.  Currently, the patient does state that his hernia bothers him more so than his colostomy, and if it were not for the hernia then he may just refrain from having his colostomy reversed; however, the hernia has grown in size and causing him significant discomfort.  He feels that he always has to hold his hand over the hernia to prevent it from prolapsing and causing him even more discomfort.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:,1.

Otherwise, there are no further hernias or masses noted.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,This is a 43-year-old gentleman who underwent what sounds like a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch in November of 2007 secondary to perforated colon from diverticulitis.  The patient presents for reversal of his colostomy as well as repair of his incisional hernia.  I have asked the patient to return to High Point Regional and get his medical records including the operative note and pathology results from his initial surgery so that I would have a better idea of what was done during his initial surgery.  He stated that he would try and do this and bring the records to our clinic on his next appointment.  I have also set him up for a barium enema to study the rectal stump.  He will return to us in two weeks at which time we will review his radiological studies and his medical records from the outside hospital and determine the best course of action from that point.  This was discussed with the patient as well as his sister and significant other in the clinic today.  They were in agreement with this plan.  We also called the social worker to come and help the patient get more ostomy appliances, as he stated that he had no more and he was having to reuse the existing ostomy bag.  To my understanding, his social worker, as well as the ostomy nurses were able to get him some assistance with this.,nan"
3,"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient has recently had an admission for pneumonia with positive blood count.  She was treated with IV antibiotics and p.o. antibiotics; she improved on that.  She was at home and doing quite well for approximately 10 to 12 days when she came to the ER with a temperature of 102.  She was found to have strep.  She was treated with penicillin and sent home.  She returned about 8 o'clock after vomiting and a probable seizure.  Temperature was 104.5; she was lethargic after that.  She had an LP, which was unremarkable.  She had blood cultures, which have not grown anything.  The CSF has not grown anything at this point.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  She is alert, recovering from anesthesia.

Once he was anesthetized, the caudal block was placed and IV antibiotics were given.  He was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  Once he was prepped and draped, we used a straight mosquito clamp and went under the bridges and crushed them, and then excised them with a curved iris and curved tenotomy scissors.  We removed the excessive skin on the shaft skin and on the glans itself.  We then on the ventrum excised the bridge and did a Heinecke-Mikulicz closure with interrupted figure-of-eight and interrupted suture of 5-0 chromic.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  Once this was done, we then used Dermabond tissue adhesive and Surgicel to prevent the bridges from returning again.  IV Toradol was given at the end of procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.urology, heinecke-mikulicz, penile skin bridges, caudal block, penile skin, skin bridges, excision, circumcision, penile, "
1,"INDICATION FOR OPERATION:,  Right coronal synostosis with left frontal compensatory bossing causing plagiocephaly.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Syndromic craniosynostosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Syndromic craniosynostosis.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Anterior cranial vault reconstruction with fronto-orbital bar advancement.,SPECIMENS: , None.,DRAINS: , One subgaleal drain exiting from the left posterior aspect of wound.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After satisfactory general endotracheal tube anesthesia was started, the patient was placed on the operating table in supine position with the head held on a horseshoe-shaped headrest and the head was prepped and draped down the routine manner.  Here, the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and then a zigzag scalp incision was made from one ear to the other ear, posterior to the coronal suture.  Scalp incision was reflected anteriorly and then the periosteum was taken off of the bone and then the temporalis muscles were reflected anterolaterally until the anterior cranial vault was exposed and then the periorbital rim, nasion and orbital part of the zygomatic arch were all dissected out as well as the pterion.  Using a craniotome, several bur holes were made; two on the either side of the midline posteriorly and then two posterolaterally.  The two posterior bur holes were then connected with a punch over the superior sagittal sinus and then the craniotome was used to fashion a flap first on the left and then on the right, going paramedian along the superior sagittal sinus in the midline and then curving over the fronto-orbital bar.  We then dissected superior sagittal sinus off of the inner table of the right bundle flap and then connected the right bundle flap going across the pterion on the right, which was abnormal.  The pterion on the right was then run short down after removing both bone flaps and then the dura was dissected off from the orbital roofs.  On the right, the orbital roof was jagged and abnormal and we had to repair a CSF leak from where the dura was punctured by the orbital roof.  The orbital rim was then dissected out and then using the saw and chisels, we were able to make the releasing cuts to free up the orbital rims, zygomatic arch and then remove the orbital bar going posteriorly and then the distal bar was split in the middle and then reapproximated with a bone graft in the middle to move the orbits out a little bit and the orbital bar was held together using absorbable plate.  It was then replaced and advanced and then relaxing, barrel-staving incisions were made in the bone flaps and the orbital rim and it was held on the right side with an absorbable plate to fix it in the proper position.  The bone flaps were then reapproximated using absorbable plates and screws, as well as #2-0 Vicryl to secure back into place.  Some of the places were also secured in the midline posteriorly, as well as off to the right where the bony defects were in place.  The periosteum was then brought over the skull and fastened in place and the temporalis muscles were tacked up to the periosteum.  The wounds were irrigated out.  A drain was left in posteriorly and then the wounds were closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the galea and fast-absorbing gut for the skin followed by sterile dressings.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and did receive blood transfusions.neurosurgery, coronal synostosis, syndromic craniosynostosis, craniosynostosis, plagiocephaly, fronto-orbital bar, cranial vault reconstruction, cranial vault, orbital bar, orbital, cranial,"

1,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified.  The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given anesthetic.,Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed.  It revealed no patholigamentous laxity.  We then placed the patient into a beach-chair position, maintaining a neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax.  The shoulder was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  We then injected the glenohumeral joint with 60 cc of sterile saline solution.  A small stab incision was made 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion.  Through this incision, a blunt trocar was placed.,We then placed the camera through this cannula and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline solution.  An anterior portal was made just below the subscapularis and then we began to inspect the shoulder joint.,We found that the articular surface was in good condition.  The biceps was found to be intact.  There was a SLAP tear noted just posterior to the biceps.  Pictures were taken.  No Bankart or Hill-Sachs lesions were noted.  The rotator cuff was examined and there were no undersurface tears.  Pictures were again taken.,We then made a lateral portal going through the muscle belly of the rotator cuff.  A drill hole was made and then knotless suture anchor was placed to repair this.  Pictures were taken.  We then washed out the joint with copious amounts of sterile saline solution.  It was drained.  Our 3 incisions were closed using 3-0 nylon suture.  A pain pump catheter was introduced into the shoulder joint.  Xeroform, 4 x 4s, ABDs, tape, and sling were placed.,The patient was successfully taken out of the beach-chair position, extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.  I then went out and spoke with the patient's family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care.surgery, laxity, patholigamentous, superior labrum, saline solution, anterior, superior, lesions, repair, sterile, joint, shoulder,"
4,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hip degenerative arthritis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hip degenerative arthritis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Total hip arthroplasty on the left.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,BLOOD LOSS: , 800 cc.,The patient was positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag.,IMPLANT SPECIFICATION: , A 54 mm Trilogy cup with cluster holes 3 x 50 mm diameter with a appropriate liner, a 28 mm cobalt-chrome head with a zero neck length head, and a 12 mm porous proximal collared femoral component.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Severe degenerative changes within the femoral head as well as the acetabulum, anterior as well as posterior osteophytes.  The patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductors and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis.  This was revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursa.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months.,Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the above-named procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to the Operating Room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/27/03.  The general anesthetic was first performed by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position.  Kidney rests were also used because of the patient's size.  An axillary roll was also inserted for comfort in addition to a Foley catheter, which was inserted by the OR nurse.  All her bony prominences were well padded.  At this time, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  At this time, an anterolateral approach was then performed, first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inches of subcutaneous fat.  The tensor fascia lata was then identified.  A self-retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field.  Bovie cautery was used for hemostasis.  At this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one-third of the greater trochanter.  At this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally.  The tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor.  At this time, after hemostasis was obtained, Bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius.  At this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule.  A ________ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  Once this was performed, Homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  At this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a Bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  At this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum.  At this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  At this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  We made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  At this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut.,The femoral head was then removed.  At this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and Homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum.  A long-handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  With better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  We started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  At the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum.  We then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  A size 54 mm Trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in.  Once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  At this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup.  At this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection.  The leg was then placed back in the bag.  A Bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  A rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  A Box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  A Charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  A power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  At this time, we began broaching.  We started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  Once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  A calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly.  A standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed.  Once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  At this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  This was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening.  Once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  We copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  At this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place.  Once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  The 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the Morse taper assured that this was well fixed by ________.,Next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion.  We were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components.  Copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 Ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter.  Next, a #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  A tight closure was performed.  Since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Staples were then used for skin closure.  The patient's hip was then cleansed.  Sterile dressings consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, ABDs, and foam tape were then placed.  A drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  After the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.

3,"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  The patient is a very pleasant 44-year-old white female quite obese.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure:  122/70.

We will start her on Detrol 0.4 mg one daily and also started on Mobic 15 mg per day.,2.  Elevate her leg as much as possible and wear support hose if possible.  Keep her foot up during the day.  We will see her back in two weeks.  We will have the results of the Doppler, the lab work and see how she is doing with the Detrol and the joint pain.  If her shoulder pain is not any better, we probably should refer her on over to orthopedist.  We did do x-rays of her shoulder today that did not show anything remarkable.

4,"REASON FOR VISIT: , The patient referred by Dr. X for evaluation of her possible tethered cord.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Briefly, she is a 14-year-old right handed female who is in 9th grade, who underwent a lipomyomeningocele repair at 3 days of age and then again at 3-1/2 years of age.  The last surgery was in 03/95.  She did well; however, in the past several months has had some leg pain in both legs out laterally, worsening at night and requiring Advil, Motrin as well as Tylenol PM.,Denies any new bowel or bladder dysfunction or increased sensory loss.

3,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Coronary artery disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,LEFT HEART CATHETERIZATION WITH ANGIOGRAPHY AND MID ABDOMINAL AORTOGRAPHY:,Under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with premedication, a right groin preparation was done.  Using the percutaneous Seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  Coronary arteriography was performed with 6-French performed coronary catheters.  We used a 6-French JR4 and JL4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  After using the JR4 6-French catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-French JR4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  A pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta.,ANALYSIS OF PRESSURE DATA: , Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmHg.  On continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  The aortic pressures were normal.  Contours of intracardiac pressure were normal.,ANALYSIS OF ANGIOGRAMS:,  Selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  A pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  The mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  The left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  Aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  The aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  The ascending aorta appeared normal.,Pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  An abdominal aortic injection was performed.  Under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  There was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  The abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  There is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  The celiac seems to be normal, but what I believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  The common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area.,CORONARY ANATOMY:,  One notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  Cineangiogram obtained with 6-French JR4 and 5-French JR4 catheters.  Prior to the introduction of the 5-French JR4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  The 6-French JR4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  There was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  In the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the Shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  Then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  The distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  The conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  We then removed the 6-French catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-French catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  At the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  Backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the Shepherd turn area.,The left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  It forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery.,The left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  There appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  It gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  The remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  Upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what I believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  I could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place.,The ramus branch is normal and free of disease.,The left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease.,The patient has a predominantly right coronary system.  There is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The catheter was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size.,2.  Calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels.  The left and right renal arteries are normal.  The external iliac arteries are normal.,3.  Essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.,4.  Ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  The proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.,5.  Coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,The patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  The ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  It is at least 50%, but it could be worse.

Preoperative MRI scan showed evidence of herniated nucleus pulposus at C5-C6 and C6-C7 on the left.  The patient has failed epidural steroid injections.  Risks and benefits of the above procedure were discussed with the patient including bleeding, infection, muscle loss, nerve damage, paralysis, and death.,OPERATIVE REPORT: , The patient was taken to the OR and placed in the supine position.  After general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient's neck was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A horizontal incision was made on the left side of the neck at the level of the C6 vertebral body.  It was taken down through the subcutaneous tissues exposing the platysmus muscle.  The platysmus muscle was incised along the skin incision and the deep cervical fascia was bluntly dissected down to the anterior cervical spine.  An #18 gauge needle was placed in the C5-C6 interspace and the intraoperative x-ray confirmed that this was the appropriate level.  Next, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally on both the right and left side, and then a complete anterior cervical discectomy was performed.  The disk was very degenerated and brown in color.  There was an acute disk herniation through posterior longitudinal ligament.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and a bilateral foraminotomy was performed.  Approximately, 5 mm of the nerve root on both the right and left side was visualized.  A ball-ended probe could be passed up the foramen.  Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo.  The end plates of C5 and C6 were prepared using a high-speed burr and a 6-mm lordotic machined allograft was malleted into place.  There was good bony apposition both proximally and distally.  Next, attention was placed at the C6-C7 level.  Again, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally and a complete anterior cervical discectomy at C6-C7 was performed.  The disk was degenerated and there was acute disk herniation in the posterior longitudinal ligament on the left.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed.  A bilateral foraminotomy was performed.  Approximately, 5 mm of the C7 nerve root was visualized on both sides.  A micro nerve hook was able to be passed up the foramen easily.  Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo.  The end plates at C6-C7 were then prepared using a high-speed burr and then a 7-mm machined lordotic allograft was malleted into place.  There was good bony apposition, both proximally and distally.  Next, a 44-mm Blackstone low-profile anterior cervical plate was applied to the anterior cervical spine with six 14 mm screws.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed appropriate positioning of the plate and the graft.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with normal saline and bacitracin.  There was no active bleeding upon closure of the wound.  A small drain was placed deep.  The platysmal muscle was closed with 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with #4-0 Monocryl.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied.  The patient was monitored throughout the procedure with free-running EMGs and SSEPs and there were no untoward events.

She presents for suture removal; however, there is still fluid noted now at the antihelix fold above the concha bullosa below previous sutures placed by Dr. X.  It was recommended that this area be drained through the previous incision and drainage incision which has healed and wound care by the patient appears to be very poor if any at all being performed which may be complicating matters.  Consent was obtained.  The patient is aware that the complications with this ear area severe and auricular deformity is inevitable; however, quick prompt aggressive drainage addressing fluid collections offers a best chance for improvement from an already very difficult situation.,The area was prepped in the usual manner, localized and the previous incision was reopened with a curved hemostat and about 5 mL of serosanguineous drainage was noted.  A through-and-through Keith needle bolster dressing was applied with cottonoid pledget on both sides of the ear to help compression.

3,"INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:,  Persistent cough productive of sputum requiring repeated courses of oral antibiotics over the last six weeks in a patient who is a recipient of a bone marrow transplant with end-stage chemotherapy and radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.,PREMEDICATION:,1.  Demerol 50 mg.,2.  Phenergan 25 mg.,3.  Atropine 0.6 mg IM.,4.  Nebulized 4% lidocaine followed by nasal insufflation of lidocaine through the right naris and topical 4% lidocaine gel through the right naris, 4 mg of Versed was given at the start of the procedure and another 1 mg shortly after traversing the cords.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  With the patient breathing oxygen by nasal cannula, being monitored by noninvasive blood pressure cuff and continuous pulse oximetry, the Olympus bronchoscope was introduced through the right naris to the level of the cords.  The cords move normally with phonation and ventilation.  Two times 2 mL of 1% lidocaine were instilled on the cords and the cords were traversed.  Further 2 mL of 1% lidocaine was instilled in the trachea just distal to the cords, at mid trachea above the carina, and on the right, and on the left mainstem bronchus.  Scope was then introduced on to the left where immediately some hyperemia of the mucosa was noted.  Upper lobe and lingula were unremarkable.  There appeared to be some narrowing or tenting of the left lower lobe bronchus such that after inspection of the superior segment, one almost had to pop the bronchoscope around to go down the left mainstem.  This had been a change from the prior bronchoscopy of unclear significance.  Distal to this, there was no hyperemia or inspissated mucus or mucoid secretions or signs of infection.  The scope was wedged in the left lower lobe posterior basal segment and a BAL was done with good returns, which were faintly hemorrhagic.  The scope was then removed, re-introduced up to the right upper lobe, middle lobe, superior segment, right lower, anterior lateral, and posterior basal subsegments were all evaluated and unremarkable.  The scope was withdrawn.  The patient's saturation remained 93%-95% throughout the procedure.  Blood pressure was 103/62.  Heart rate at the end of the procedure was about 100.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Samples were sent as follows.  Washings for AFB, Gram-stain Nocardia, Aspergillus, and routine culture.

3,"HISTORY:,  Reason for ICU followup today is acute anemia secondary to upper GI bleeding with melena with dropping hemoglobin from 11 to 8, status post transfusion of 2 units PRBCs with EGD performed earlier today by Dr. X of Gastroenterology confirming diagnosis of ulcerative esophagitis, also for continuing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with productive cough, infection and shortness of breath.  Please see dictated ICU transfer note yesterday detailing the need for emergent transfer transfusion and EGD in this patient.  Over the last 24 hours, the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value.  He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X.  I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding.  Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future.  The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU.  He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8.  Is and Os negative fluid balance of 1.4 liters in the last 24 hours.,GENERAL:  This is a somnolent 68-year-old male, who arouses to voice, wakes up, seems to have good appetite, has continuing cough.

Capillary refill time is now normal in the fingertips.,NEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact with no focal neurological deficits.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Laboratories drawn at 1449 today, WBC 10, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11.5 and 33.1, and platelets 288,000.  This is up from 8.6 and 24.7.  Platelets are stable.  Sodium is 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarb 26, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, glucose 73, calcium 8.4, INR 0.96, iron 13%, saturations 4%, TIBC 312, TSH 0.74, CEA elevated at 8.6, ferritin 27.5 and occult blood positive.  EGD, final results pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without signs of active bleeding at this time.,IMPRESSION/PLAN,1.  Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis.  We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding.  If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This does appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.,3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He has refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.,4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.  Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes.general medicine, anemia, gi bleeding, hemoglobin, ulcerative, esophagitis, obstructive pulmonary disease, icu followup, infection, obstructive, pulmonary, egd, melena, bleeding"

The patient is a diabetic who requires insulin, but has been noncompliant and states that his blood sugars have been out of control.  He has had a groin abdominal wound drained for about four days.  The patient states that there has been pus that has saturated his sheath.  He has had a possible fever at home that he did not chart with a thermometer.  He has had the same groin infection twice in the past with tunneling lesions.  The patient states that his wife noted there was a round scar on his abdomen and that was black and had crept up in the last day.  Bowel habits and eating were essentially normal.,Urinary habits were normal.  The patient is morbidly obese and is approximately 450 lb.  He has not been following a diabetic diet or using insulin secondary to lack of funds to put his medications.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Diabetes, morbid obesity, and nephrolithiasis.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Appendectomy and stone extraction.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was examined in the Emergency Room by Dr. X and was found to have multiple areas of erythematous tissue, which could potentially be consistent with a necrotizing fascitis texture.  The patient had a white count of 11.4 and a hemoglobin of 13.4.  Please note that the patient is a Jehovah's Witness and has adamantly refused receiving any blood products.  The risks and benefits of such were discussed with the patient at length prior to surgery and he was permitted to make sure not to receive blood and his wishes will be granted.  In the operative suite, he was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient was placed in a lithotomy position to visualize the peritoneum as well as the abdomen.  Copious amounts of Betadine solution were used to cleanse the area and the wound was visualized.  Approximately, 10 cm x 5 cm elliptical incision was made on the lower left quadrant of the abdomen surrounding the area of necrosis.  Necrotic tissue comprised approximately 2 cm x 2 cm area and was indurated.  The abdomen appeared to have a large erythematous border, however, the true indurated tissue was approximately the size of a deck of cards.  The area was incised using a #10 blade scalpel and then Bovie cauterization was used to achieve good hemostasis.  The tissue was removed using an Allis forceps as well as a Bovie to double the incision down to the fascia.  The necrotic tissue was lifted out of the abdomen.  All bleeding was cauterized using the Bovie.  A solution of gentamicin and sterile saline was placed into a high-powered water pump device and the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned.  A wet Kerlix dressing was passed into the wound and it will be left opened with wet-to-dry dressing.  The left groin area was also incised using an elliptical incision that was approximately 13 cm x 6 cm.  The tissue was incised to the muscle layer of the muscle.  There was a pus pocket that was visible with capsule as well and there was an area of the necrotic tissue as well.  There was a mild amount of pus that drained from the wound.  Cultures were taken from the groin wound and were sent to pathology.  The specimen was excised using traction with the Allis clamps as well as Bovie set on coag.  Once the tissue was excised from the ________, the area was fully irrigated using the gentamicin sterile saline solution in the high-powered water irrigation unit.  After the irrigation, the wound was packed using a wet Kerlix dressing and will be left open to heal.,It was determined at this time that both wounds will be left open to heal with the wet-to-dry dressings in place and we will come back and close the wounds at a later date.  The skin excised from the left lower abdominal quadrant as well as the left groin was sent to pathology.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in good condition.surgery, debridement, abdomen, peritoneal, pannus, pathology, necrotizing infection, necrotic tissue, tissue, infection, necrotizing, groin, wound, "
4,"CLEAR CORNEAL TEMPORAL INCISION (NO STITCHES),DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , Under satisfactory local anesthesia, the patient was appropriately prepped and draped.  A lid speculum was placed in the fissure of the right eye.,The secondary incision was then made through clear cornea using 1-mm diamond keratome at surgeon's 7:30 position and the anterior chamber re-formed using viscoelastic.  The primary incision was then made using a 3-mm diamond keratome at the surgeon's 5 o'clock position and additional viscoelastic injected into the anterior chamber as needed.  The capsulorrhexis was then performed in a standard circular tear fashion.  The nucleus was then separated from its cortical attachments by hydrodissection and emulsified in the capsular bag.  The residual cortex was then aspirated from the bag and the bag re-expanded using viscoelastic.  The posterior chamber intraocular lens was then inspected, irrigated, coated with Healon and folded, and then placed into the capsular bag under direct visualization.  The lens was noted to center well.  The residual viscoelastic was then removed from the eye and the eye re-formed using balanced salt solution.  The eye was then checked and found to be watertight; therefore, no suture was used.  The lid speculum and the drapes were then removed and the eye treated with Maxitrol ointment.,A shield was applied and the patient returned to the recovery room in good condition.ophthalmology, clear corneal temporal incision, intraocular lens, corneal temporal incision, lid speculum, incision, temporal, chamber, corneal, viscoelastic, eyeNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

1,"PROCEDURE:,  Left heart catheterization, left ventriculography, selective coronary angiography.,INDICATION: , This lady with a previous left internal mammary graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse margin branch, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch, and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery presented with recurrent difficulties with breathing.  This was felt to be related largely to chronic obstructive lung disease.  She had dynamic T-wave changes in precordial leads.  Cardiac enzymes were indeterminate.  She was evaluated by Dr. X and given her previous history and multiple risk factors it was elected to proceed with cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography.,Risks of the procedure including risks of conscious sedation, death, cerebrovascular accident, dye reaction, need for emergency surgery, vascular access injury and/or infection, and risks of cath-based interventions were discussed in detail.  The patient understood and agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.  Under Versed and fentanyl sedation, the right groin was sterilely prepped and draped.  Local anesthesia was obtained with 2% Xylocaine.  The right femoral artery was entered using modified Seldinger technique and a 4-French introducer sheath placed in that vessel.  Through the indwelling femoral arterial sheath, a JL4 4-French catheter was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta, appropriately aspirated and flushed.  Ascending aortic root pressures obtained.  This catheter was utilized in an attempt to cannulate the left coronary ostium.  This catheter was too small, was exchanged for a JL5 4-French catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta, the cath appropriately aspirated and flushed, and advanced to left coronary ostium and multiple views of left coronary artery obtained.,This catheter was then exchanged for a 4-French right coronary catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta.  The catheter appropriately aspirated and flushed.  The catheter was advanced in the right coronary artery.  Multiple views of that vessel were obtained.  The catheter was then sequentially advanced to the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch, and left internal mammary artery, left anterior descending coronary artery, and multiple views of those vessels were obtained.  This catheter was then exchanged for a 4-French pigtail catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta.  The catheter was appropriately aspirated and flushed and advanced to left ventricle, baseline left ventricular pressures obtained.,Following this, left ventriculography was performed in a 30-degree RAO projection using 30 mL of contrast injected over 3 seconds.  Post left ventriculography pressures were then obtained as was a pullback pressure across the aortic valve.  Videotapes were then reviewed.  It was elected to terminate the procedure at that point in time.,The vascular sheath was removed and manual compression carried out.  Excellent hemostasis was obtained.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complication.,RESULTS OF PROCEDURE,1.  ,HEMODYNAMICS:,  Left ventricular end-diastolic filling pressure was 24.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve.,2.  ,LEFT VENTRICULOGRAPHY: , Left ventriculography demonstrated well-preserved left ventricular systolic function.  Mild inferobasilar hypokinesis was noted.  No significant mitral regurgitation noted.  Ejection fraction was estimated at 60%.,3.  ,CORONARY ARTERIOGRAPHY,A.  ,LEFT MAIN CORONARY: , The left main coronary was patent.,B.  ,LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY:,  Left anterior descending coronary was occluded shortly after a very small first septal perforator was given.,C.  ,CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY:,  Circumflex coronary artery was occluded at its origin.,D.  ,RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY,.  Right coronary artery was occluded in its mid portion.,4.  ,SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT ANGIOGRAPHY,A.  ,SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT TO THE DIAGONAL BRANCH: , The saphenous vein graft to diagonal branch was widely patent at its origin and insertion sites.  Excellent flow was noted in the diagonal system with some retrograde flow.,B.  There was retrograde flow as well in the left anterior descending system.,C.  ,SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT TO THE OBTUSE MARGINAL SYSTEM:,  Saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal system was widely patent at its origin and insertion sites.  There was no graft disease noted.  Excellent flow was noted in the bifurcating marginal system.,D.  ,SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT TO RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:,  Saphenous vein graft to right coronary was widely patent with no graft disease.  Origin and insertion sites were free of disease.  Distal flow in the graft to the posterior descending was normal.,5.  ,LEFT INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY ANGIOGRAPHY: , Left internal mammary artery angiography demonstrated a widely patent left internal mammary at its origin and insertion sites.  There was no focal disease noted, inserted into the mid-to-distal LAD which was a small-caliber vessel.  Retrograde filling of a small septal system was noted.,SUMMARY OF RESULTS,1.  Elevated left ventricular end-diastolic filling pressure with normal left ventricular systolic function and mild hypokinesis of inferobasilar segment.nan"

3,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the ""bad crowd"" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 164 pounds, blood pressure 108/60, pulse 88, respirations 16, and temperature was not taken.  General:  He is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Psychiatric:  Alert and oriented times 3.  Skin:  I examined his upper extremities.  He showed me his injection sites.  I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.,ASSESSMENT: , Substance abuse.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotics or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It has been one week without any sort of drugs at all.  I do not think he needs weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression needs to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effects in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medications carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he has any problems or side effects, he was also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three weeks for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He has to call on his own.  He has no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.  His mom is going to keep an eye on him as well.  He is going to be staying there.  It sounds like he is looking for a job.general medicine, addicted to drugs, substance abuse, abuse, heroin, methadone"

3,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 76-year-old female that was admitted with fever, chills, and left pelvic pain.  The patient was well visiting in ABC, with her daughter that evening.  She had pain in her left posterior pelvic and low back region.  They came back to XYZ the following day.  By the time they got here, she was in severe pain and had fever.  They came straight to the emergency room.  She was admitted.  She had temperature of 104 degrees F.  It has been spiking ever since and she has had left sacroiliac type hip pain.  Multiple blood studies have been done including cultures, febrile agglutinins, etc.  She has had run a higher blood glucose to the normal and she has been on sliding scale insulin.  She was not known previously to be a diabetic.  All x-rays have not been helpful as far as to determine the etiology of her discomfort.  MRIs of the lumbar spine and the pelvis and both thighs have been unremarkable for any inflammatory process.  She does have degenerative disk disease of her lumbar spine but no hip pathology.  She has swollen inguinal nodes bilaterally.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She was not known to be a diabetic until this admission.  She had been hypertensive.  She has been on medications and has been controlled.  She has not had hyperlipidemia.  She has had no thyroid problems.  There has been no asthma, bronchitis, TB, emphysema or pneumonia.  No tuberculosis.  She has had no breast tumors.  She has had no chest pain or cardiac problems.  She has had gallbladder surgery.  She has not had any gastritis or ulcers.  She has had no kidney disease.  She has had a hysterectomy.  She has had 9 pregnancies and 8 living children.  She had A&P repair.  She had a sacral abscess after a spinal.  It sounds to me like she had a pilonidal cyst, which took about 3 operations to heal.  There have been fractures and no significant arthritis.  She has been quite active at her ranch in Mexico.  She raises goats and cattle.  She drives a tractor and in short, has been very active.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  She is a short female, alert.  She is shivering.  She has ice in her axilla and behind her neck.  She is febrile to 101 degrees F. She is alert.  Her complaint is that of hip pain in the posterior sacroiliac joint area.  She moves both her upper extremities well.  She can move her right leg well.  She actually can move her left hip and knee without much discomfort but the pain radiates from her sacroiliac joint.  She cannot stand, sit or turn without severe pain.  She has normal knee reflexes.  No ankle reflexes.  She has bounding tibial pulses.  No sensory deficit.  She says she knows when she has to void.  She has a healed scar in the upper sacral region.  There is some bruising around the buttocks but the daughter says that is from her being in bed lying on her back.,PLAN: , My plan is to do a triple-phase bone scan.  I am suspecting an infection possibly in the left sacroiliac joint.  It is probably some type of bacterium, the etiology of which is undetermined.  She has had a normal white count despite her fever.  There has been a history of brucellosis in the past, but her titers at this time are negative.  Continue medication which included antibiotics and also the Motrin and Darvocet.,general medicine, inflammatory, degenerative, fever, lumbar spine, sacroiliac joint, inguinal, sacroiliac, hip,"

2,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Hip pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the Pain Management Clinic, as well as from my residency training program, San Francisco. We have worked collaboratively for many years at the Pain Management Clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  She reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  In essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  She was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  With time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in San Francisco in her mid 30s by Dr. V, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at Hospital.  She was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  Most of this was focused on her SI joints.  At that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  This was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the Boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  She was seen at the Pain Center by Dr. R with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  She was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  Medications at that time were salicylate and Ultram.,When she returned to Portland in 1996, she was then working for Dr. B.  She was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  Subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  Orthotics were provided.  She was given Paxil and Tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  During this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  She has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  She currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  She is establishing care with Dr. S, of Rheumatology for her ongoing care.  Up until today, her pain medications were being written by Dr. Y prior to establishing with Dr. L.,Pain management in town had been first provided by the office of Dr. F. Under his care, followup MRIs were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  A number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with Flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  She then transferred her care to Ab Cd, FNP under the direction of Dr. K.  Her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  Because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,1.

The patient was noted with acute respiratory distress on ventilator support with both ventilator asynchrony and progressive desaturation.  Chest x-ray as noted above revealed complete atelectasis of the left lung.  The patient was subsequently sedated and received one dose of paralytic as noted above followed by emergent fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy.,PROCEDURE DETAIL,:  A bronchoscope was inserted through the oroendotracheal tube, which was partially obstructed with blood clots.  These were lavaged with several aliquots of normal saline until cleared.  The bronchoscope required removal because the tissue/clots were obstructing the bronchoscope.  The bronchoscope was reinserted on several occasions until cleared and advanced to the main carina.  The endotracheal tube was noted to be in good position.  The bronchoscope was advanced through the distal trachea.  There was a white tissue completely obstructing the left main stem at the carina.  The bronchoscope was advanced to this region and several aliquots of normal saline lavage were instilled and suctioned.  Again this partially obstructed the bronchoscope requiring several times removing the bronchoscope to clear the lumen.  The bronchoscope subsequently was advanced into the left mainstem and subsequently left upper and lower lobes.  There was diffuse mucus impactions/tissue as well as intermittent clots.  There was no evidence of any active bleeding noted.  Bronchoscope was adjusted and the left lung lavaged until no evidence of any endobronchial obstruction is noted.  Bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the main carina and advanced into the right bronchial system.  There is no plugging or obstruction of the right bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the main carina and slowly withdrawn as the position of endotracheal tube was verified, approximately 4 cm above the main carina.  The bronchoscope was then completely withdrawn as the patient was maintained on ventilator support during and postprocedure.  Throughout the procedure, pulse oximetry was greater than 95% throughout.  There is no hemodynamic instability or variability noted during the procedure.

Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects.,I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI.,She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.  She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain.  The right hand weakness continues.  She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her.,She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms.,She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.

There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views.,Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6.  These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level.  Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7.  This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5.,Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness.,I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options.,I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions.,The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done.  I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness.,She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention.,I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model.,I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain.  She understands.,I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient's relatively young age.  Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies.,I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty.  She understands.,She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon.  She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then.  Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07.  She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process.nan"

3,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Patient is a 72-year-old white male complaining of a wooden splinter lodged beneath his left fifth fingernail, sustained at 4 p.m. yesterday.  He attempted to remove it with tweezers at home, but was unsuccessful.  He is requesting we attempt to remove this for him.,The patient believes it has been over 10 years since his last tetanus shot, but states he has been allergic to previous immunizations primarily with ""horse serum.""  Consequently, he has declined to update his tetanus immunization.,MEDICATIONS: , He is currently on several medications, a list of which is attached to the chart, and was reviewed.  He is not on any blood thinners.,ALLERGIES: , HE IS ALLERGIC ONLY TO TETANUS SERUM.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Patient is married and is a nonsmoker and lives with his wife.  ,Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Temp and vital signs are all within normal limits.,GENERAL:  The patient is a pleasant elderly white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.,EXTREMITIES:  Exam of the left fifth finger shows a 5- to 6-mm splinter lodged beneath the medial aspect of the nail plate.  It does not protrude beyond the end of the nail plate.  There is no active bleeding.  There is no edema or erythema of the digit tip.  Flexion and extension of the DIP joint is intact.  The remainder of the hand is unremarkable.,TREATMENT: , I did attempt to grasp the end of the splinter with splinter forceps, but it is brittle and continues to break off.  In order to better grasp the splinter, will require penetration beneath the nail plate, which the patient cannot tolerate due to pain.  Consequently, the base of the digit tip was prepped with Betadine, and just distal to the DIP joint, a digital block was applied with 1% lidocaine with complete analgesia of the digit tip.  I was able to grasp the splinter and remove this.  No further foreign body was seen beneath the nail plate and the area was cleansed and dressed with bacitracin and bandage.,ASSESSMENT: , Foreign body of the left fifth fingernail (wooden splinter).,PLAN: , Patient was urged to clean the area b.i.d. with soap and water and to dress with bacitracin and a Band-Aid.  If he notes increasing redness, pain, or swelling, he was urged to return for re-evaluation.general medicine, horse serum, wooden splinter, foreign body, nail plate, grasp, fingernail, splinter,"
2,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal.,He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Pneumonia.  He has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which started at approximately age 20.  These have been treated repeatedly over the years, and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years, although this has been far more frequent in the past year.  He is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged.  There is no known history of bronchiectasis, inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia.,2.  He has had a catheter placed for urinary retention, his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement.  The patient does not have any history of diabetes and does not report any other medical problems.  He has lost approximately 18 pounds in the past month.,3.  He had an appendectomy in the 1940s.,4.  He had an ankle resection in 1975.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient stopped smoking 27 years ago, he smoked approximately two packs a day with combined cigarettes and cigars.  He has not smoked for the past 27 years.  He hardly ever uses alcohol.  He is currently retired.,FAMILY HISTORY: , There is no family history of neuropathy, pes cavus, foot deformities, or neuromuscular diseases.  His aunt has a history of type II diabetes.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg p.o. q.d., midodrine 5 mg p.o. q.i.d., Cymbalta 30 mg p.o. per day, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. per day, Lortab 10 mg p.o. per day, Amoxil 500 mg p.o. per day, vitamin B12 1000 mcg weekly, vitamin D 1000 units per day, Metamucil p.r.n., enteric-coated aspirin once a day, Colace 200 mg p.o. q.d., Senokot three tablets p.o. p.r.n., Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.6h., Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n., Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. and Dilaudid 2 mg tablets p.o. q.3h. p.r.n., Protonix 40 mg per day, and Megace 400 mg per day.,ALLERGIES:,  He has no medication or food allergies.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Please see the health questionnaire and clinical notes from today.,GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  BP was 137/60, P was 89, and his weight could not be measured because he was in a wheelchair.  His pain score was 0.,APPEARANCE:  No acute distress.  He is pleasant and well-groomed.,HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  No carotid bruits appreciated.,LUNGS:  There were few coarse crackles in both lung bases.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Revealed a normal first and second heart sound, with no third or fourth heart sound and no murmurs.  The pulse was regular and of normal volume.,ABDOMEN:  Soft with no masses and normal bowel sounds.  There were no carotid bruits.,EXTREMITIES:  No contractures appreciated.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:,MSE:  His orientation, language, calculations, 100-7 tests were all normal.  There was atrophy and fasciculations in both the arms and legs.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerve examination was normal with the exception that there was some mild atrophy of his tongue and possible fasciculations.  His palatal movement was normal and gag reflex was normal.,MOTOR:  Strength was decreased in all muscle groups as follows:  Deltoid 4/4, biceps 4+/4+, triceps 5/5, wrist extensors 4+/4+, finger extensors 4-/4-, finger flexors 4-/4-, interossei 4-/4-, hip flexors 4+/4+, hip extensors 4+/4+, knee extensors 4/4, and knee flexors 4/4.  Foot dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, toe extension and toe flexion was all 0 to 1.  There was atrophy in both hands and general atrophy of the lower limb muscles.  The feet were both cold and showed dystrophic features.  Fasciculations were present mainly in the hands.  There was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand.,REFLEXES:  Reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs.  The jaw reflex was 2+.  Vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers.  Vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee.  Joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers.  Pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs.  Pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows.  The same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing.,COORDINATION:  Coordination was barely normal in the right hand.  Rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand.  The patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, Romberg's test and balance could not be assessed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , Previous diagnostic studies and patient reports.  There were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed.  A previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in October 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate.  An x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.  A CTA of the neck with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis.  The posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis.  There was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted.  An MRI of the brain with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration.  There was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis.  This was an essentially normal brain MRI.  A CBC performed in January 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated MCH of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal.  An electrolyte study performed in January 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1.  The glucose was 86.  TSH performed in January 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range.  Vitamin B12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal.  A myocardial stress study performed in December 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with Persantine Cardiolite SPECT.  The ECG was non-diagnostic.  There was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males.  A CT of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in December 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5.  At L5-S1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis.  There was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at L1-L4.  An echocardiogram was performed in November 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings.  He is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities.  His proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia.  According to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since July 2008.  As indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and EMG test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy.  There was no involvement of the tongue on EMG.  The laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy.  We are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the Mayo Clinic.  This type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as SLE, Sjogren's, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease.  In addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents.  The patient did not receive any of these.  It may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking.  We have requested that he obtain a CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in Acute Rehabilitation.  The verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer.  We did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.  The patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm.  This showed evidence of severe axonal loss.  There was no evidence of a vasculitis.  The vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis.  There were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections.  The muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping.  Again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis.  Evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy.  Specifically, there is no history of HIV exposure.  We would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis.  At this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed.  I have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son.  We also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy.  I think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder.,There is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.  However, since I have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, I cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this.,PLAN:,1.  Nerve conduction and EMG will be performed today.  The results were indicated above.,2.  The following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, CBC, thyroid function tests, B12, ANA, C-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded DNA antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin A1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the Mayo Clinic, B12.  These studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7.  The B12 was greater than 2000.  The immunoelectrophoresis, ANA, double-stranded DNA, ANCA, hemoglobin A1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, C-reactive protein were all normal or negative.  The B12 level was greater than 2000.  Liver function tests were normal.  The glucose was 90.  ESR was 10.  Hemoglobin A1c was 5.5.,3.  A left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above.,4.  CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis.,5.  Whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.,6.  The patient will go to the Rehabilitation Facility for Acute Rehabilitation and Training.,7.  We have not made any changes to his medication.  He does have some mild orthostatic changes; however, he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day.  Usually, he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day.,8.  Followup will be as determined by the family.nan"
2,"LEXISCAN MYOVIEW STRESS STUDY,REASON FOR THE EXAM: , Chest discomfort.,INTERPRETATION: , The patient exercised according to the Lexiscan study, received a total of 0.4 mg of Lexiscan IV injection.  At peak hyperemic effect, 24.9 mCi of Myoview were injected for the stress imaging and earlier 8.2 mCi were injected for the resting and the usual SPECT and gated SPECT protocol was followed and the data was analyzed using Cedars-Sinai software.  The patient did not walk because of prior history of inability to exercise long enough on treadmill.,The resting heart rate was 57 with the resting blood pressure 143/94.  Maximum heart rate achieved was 90 with a maximum blood pressure unchanged.,EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave changes of reversible ischemia or injury.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Ovarian cancer.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Ovarian cancer.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Insertion of a Port-A-Catheter via the left subclavian vein approach under fluoroscopic guidance.,DETAILED OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table and placed under LMA general anesthesia in preparation for insertion of a Port-A-Catheter.  The chest was prepped and draped in the routine fashion for insertion of a Port-A-Catheter.  The left subclavian vein was punctured with a single stick and a guidewire threaded through the needle into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was removed.  An incision was made over the guidewire for entrance of the dilator with sheath.  A second counter incision was made transversally on the chest wall about an inch and half below the puncture site with a #15 blade.  Hemostasis was effective to electrocautery, and a pocket was fashioned subcutaneously for positioning of the reservoir.  The Port-A-Catheter reservoir tubing was attached to the reservoir in the routine fashion.  The reservoir was placed in the pocket and sutured to the anterior chest wall muscle with three interrupted 4-0 Prolene sutures for stability.  Next, a catheter passer was passed from the pocket exiting through the skin at the puncture site, previously placed for the guidewire, and the Port-A-Catheter was pulled from the reservoir exiting on the skin.  It was placed on the chest, measured, and cut to the appropriate length.  This having been done, the dilator with sheath attached was passed over the guidewire into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The guidewire and dilator were removed, and the Port-A-Catheter was threaded through the sheath into the superior vena cava, and the sheath removed under fluoroscopic guidance.  Fluoroscopy revealed the Port-A-Catheter to be in excellent position.  The Port-A-Catheter was accessed with a butterfly 90-degree needle percutaneously that drew blood well and flushed easily.  It was flushed with heparinized saline connected in cath.  This having been done, the puncture site was closed with a circumferential subcutaneous 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with a percutaneous circumferential subcuticular suture.  This having been done, attention was applied to the reservoir incision.  It was closed with two layers of continuous 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with a continuous 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular stitch.  A dry sterile dressing was applied, and the patient having tolerated the procedure was transferred to the recovery room for postoperative care.surgery, ovarian cancer, insertion, port-a-catheter, circumferential, counter incision, fluoroscopic, fluoroscopic guidance, guidewire, subclavian, superior vena cava, port a catheter, port, catheter, subcutaneously, vein"

4,"PROCEDURE:,  Total hip replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally.  The piriformis and external rotators were identified.  These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule.  The hip was dislocated.  A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating.  The femoral head was removed.  Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum.,Baseline leg-length measurements were taken.  The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed.  Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas.  The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit.  The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction.  Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  The trial liner was placed.,The femur was then flexed and internally rotated.  The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion.  An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal.  Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached.  The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version.  Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement.  Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation.  The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination.  Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability.,The real stem was opened and impacted into position.  The real head was impacted atop the stem.  If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version.  Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component.  Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction.,The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy.  The gluteus maximus was repaired using 0 Ethibond and 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was closed with nylon.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.orthopedic, range-of-motion, hip, total hip replacement, gluteus maximus, femoral head, subcutaneous tissues, incision, ethibond, trochanter, subcutaneous, acetabulum, femur"

Uremia.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Insertion of a right internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheter.,ANESTHESIA: , 1% local lidocaine.,BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 5 cc.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,HISTORY: , The patient is a 74-year-old Caucasian male who presents via direct admission for acute on chronic renal failure with uremia.  The patient incidentally was in a car accident ten days ago and has been feeling pretty awful since that time.  He is slightly short of breath with mild difficulty in breathing.  A pre-procedure x-ray was obtained, which showed no pneumothorax.  He did have a significant right pleural effusion and a mild left pleural effusion.  We decided to insert the catheter on the right side.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine was used to anesthetize the area two fingerbreadths above the clavicle just posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and below the external jugular vein.  Using the same anesthetic needle, the right internal jugular vein was used to cannulate with good venous blood return.  The tract was noted.,The needle was removed and a second #18 gauge thin-walled needle was used along same tract to cannulate the right internal jugular vein also without difficulty and good venous blood return.  The syringe was removed and a Seldinger guidewire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the vein also without difficulty.  The needle was removed and an #11 blade was used to make a small skin incision provided skin and vein dilators were used.  The circle-C 8-inch hemodialysis catheter was then inserted over the guidewire without difficulty.  The guidewire was removed.  Both of the ports were aspirated venous blood without difficulty and both flushed also without difficulty.  The ports were flushed with injectable normal saline secondary to the patient going for dialysis today.  Thus, he will not need heparinization of the lines.  Again, he tolerated the procedure well.  A postoperative x-ray would be obtained to check catheter placement and rule out pneumothorax.surgery, uremia, internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheter, pneumothorax, jugular vein, dialysis, chronic renal failure, internal jugular vein, pleural effusion, hemodialysis catheter, renal failure, cannulate, guidewire, insertion, jugular, catheter, hemodialysis, vein"
1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral degenerative arthritis of the knees.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral degenerative arthritis of the knees.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Right total knee arthroplasty done in conjunction with a left total knee arthroplasty, which will be dictated separately.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Bilateral procedure was 400 cc.,TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,75 minutes.,COMPONENTS: , Include the Zimmer NexGen complete knee solution system, which include a size F right cruciate retaining femoral component, a size #8 peg tibial component precoat, a All-Poly standard size 38, 9.5 mm thickness patellar component, and a prolonged highly cross-linked polyethylene NexGen cruciate retaining tibial articular surface size blue 12 mm height.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 69-year-old male who presented to the office complaining of bilateral knee pain for a couple of years.  The patient complained of clicking noises and stiffness, which affected his daily activities of living.,PROCEDURE: , After all potential complications, risks as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure was discussed at length, the patient's informed consent was obtained.,Operative extremities were then confirmed with the operating surgeons as well as the nursing staff, Department of Anesthesia, and the patient.  The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to operative suite #2 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  At this time, Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient was allowed in DVT study and the right extremity was in the Esmarch study as well as the left.  The nonsterile tourniquet was then applied to the right upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  The right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The right upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated using 325 mmHg.  The patient was a consideration for a unicompartmental knee replacement.  So, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a limited midline longitudinal incision was made directly over the patella.  A sharp dissection was then taken down to the level of the fascia in line with the patella as well as the quadriceps tendon.  Next, a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed using the #10 blade scalpel.  Upon viewing of the articular surfaces, there was significant ware in the trochlear groove as well as the medial femoral condyle and it was elected to proceed with total knee replacement.  At this time, the skin incisions as well as the deep incisions were extended proximally and distally in a midline fashion.  Total incision now measured approximately 25 cm.  Retractors were placed.  Next, attention was directed to establishing medial and lateral flaps of the proximal tibia.  Reciprocating osteal elevator was used to establish soft tissue plane and then an electrocautery was then used to subperiosteal strip medially and laterally on the proximal tibia.  At this time, the patella was then everted.  The knee was flexed up to 90 degrees.  Next, using the large drill bit, the femoral canal was then opened in appropriate position.  The intramedullary sizing guide was then placed and the knee was sized to a size F. At this time, the three degrees external rotation holes were then drilled after carefully assessing the epicondylar access as well as the white sideline.  The guide was then removed.  The intramedullary guide was then placed with nails holding the guide in three degrees of external rotation.  Next, the anterior femoral resection guide was then placed and clamped into place using a pointed _________________ was then used to confirm that there would no notching performed.  Next, soft tissue retractors were placed and an oscillating saw was used to make the anterior femoral cut.  Upon checking, it was noted to be flat with no oscillations.  The anterior guide was then removed and the distal femoral resection guide was placed in five degrees of valgus.  It was secured in place using nails.  The intramedullary guide was then removed and the standard distal femoral cut was then made using oscillating saw.,This was then removed and the size F distal finishing femoral guide was then placed on the femur in proper position.  Bony and soft tissue landmarks were confirmed and the resection guide was then held in place using nail as well as spring screws.  Again, the collateral ligament retractors were then placed and the oscillating saw was used to make each of the anterior and posterior as well as each chamfer cut.  A reciprocating saw was then used to cut the trochlear cut and the peg holes were drilled as well.  The distal finishing guide was then removed and osteotome was then used to remove all resected bone.  The oscillating saw was then used to complete the femoral notch cut.  Upon viewing, there appeared to be proper amount of bony resection and all bone was removed completely.  There was no posterior osteophytes noted and no fragments to the posterior aspect.  Next, attention was directed towards the tibia.  The external tibial guide was reflected.  This was placed on the anterior tibia and held in place using nails after confirming the proper varus and valgus position.  The resection guide was then checked and appeared to be sufficient amount of resection in both medial and lateral condyles of the tibia.  Next, collateral ligament retractors were placed as well as McGill retractors for the PCL.  Oscillating saw was then used to make the proximal tibial cut.  Osteotome was used to remove this excess resected bone.  The laminar spreader was then used to check the flexion and extension.  The gaps appeared to be equal.  The external guide was then removed and trial components were placed to a size F femoral component and a 12 mm tibial component on a size 8 tray.  The knee was taken through range of motion and had very good flexion as well as full extension.  There appeared to be good varus and valgus stability as well.  Next, attention was directed towards the patella.  There noted to be a sufficient ware and it was selected to replace the patella.  It was sized with caliper, pre-cut and noted to be 26 mm depth.  The sizing guide was then used and a size 51 resection guide selected.  A 51 mm reamer was then placed and sufficient amount of patella was then removed.  The calcar was then used to check again and there was noted to be 15 mm remaining.  The 38 mm patella guide was then placed on the patella.  It was noted to be in proper size and the three drill holes for the pegs were used.  A trial component was then placed.  The knee was taken through range of motion.  There was noted to be some subluxation lateral to the patellar component and a lateral release was performed.  After this, the component appeared to be tracking very well.  There remained a good range of motion in the knee and extension as well as flexion.  At this time, an AP x-ray of the knee was taken with the trial components in place.  Upon viewing this x-ray, it appeared that the tibial cut was in neutral, all components in proper positioning.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and dried.  The knee was then flexed ___________ placed, and the peg drill guide was placed on the tibia in proper position, held in place with nails.,The four peg holes were then drilled.  The knee again was copiously irrigated and suction dried.  The final components were then selected again consisting of size F femoral components.  A peg size 8 tibial component, a 12 mm height articular surface, size blue, and a 38 mm 9.5 mm thickness All-Poly patella.  Polymethyl methacrylate was then prepared at this time.  The proximal tibia was dried and the cement was then pressed into place.  The cement was then placed on the backside of the tibial component and the tibial component was then impacted into proper positioning.  Next, the proximal femur was cleaned and dried.  Polymethyl methacrylate was placed on the resected portions of the femur as well as the backside of the femoral components.  This was then impacted in place as well.  At this time, all excess cement was removed from both the tibial and femoral components.  A size 12 mm trial tibial articular surface was then put in place.  The knee was reduced and held in loading position throughout the remaining drying position of the cement.  Next, the resected patella was cleaned and dried.  The cement was placed on the patella as well as the backside of the patellar component.  The component was then put in proper positioning and held in place with a clamp.  All excess polymethyl methacrylate was removed from this area as well.  This was held until the cement had hardened sufficiently.  Next, the knee was examined.  All excess cement was then removed.  The knee was taken through range of motion with sufficient range of motion as well as stability.  The final 12 mm height polyethylene tibial component was then put into place and snapped down in proper position.  Again range of motion was noted to be sufficient.  The knee was copiously irrigated and suction dried once again.  A drain was then placed within the knee.  The wound was then closed first using #1 Ethibond to close the arthrotomy oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  The knee was again copiously irrigated and dried.  The skin was closed using #2-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion followed by staples on the skin.  The ConstaVac was then _______ to the drain.  Sterile dressing was applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, Kerlix, and a 6-inch Dupre roll from foot to thigh.  Department of Anesthesia then reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit.

1,"REASON FOR VISIT: , This is a cosmetic consultation.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a very pleasant 34-year-old white female who is a nurse in the operating room.  She knows me through the operating room and has asked me to possibly perform cosmetic surgery on her.  She is very bright and well informed about cosmetic surgery.  She has recently had some neck surgery for a re-fusion of her neck and is currently on methadone for chronic pain regarding this.  Her current desires are that she obtain a breast augmentation and liposuction of her abdomen, and she came to me mostly because I offer transumbilical breast augmentation.  Her breasts are reportedly healthy without any significant problems.  Her weight is currently stable.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: ,  Negative.  Past surgical history is significant for a second anterior cervical fusion and diskectomy in 02/05 and in 09/06.  She has had no previous cosmetic or aesthetic surgery.,FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Significant for Huntington disease in her mother and diabetes in her father.  Her brother has an aneurysm.  She does occasionally smoke and has been trying to quit recently.  She is currently smoking about a pack a day.  She drinks about once a week.  She is currently a registered nurse, circulator, and scrub technician in the operating room at Hopkins.  She has no children.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,A 12-system review is significant for some musculoskeletal pain, mostly around her neck and thoracic region.  She does have occasional rash on her chest and problems with sleep and anxiety that are related to her chronic pain.  She has considered difficult airway due to anterior cervical disk fusion and instability.  Her last mammogram was in 2000.  She has a size 38C breast.,MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are 5 mg of methadone three times a day and amitriptyline at night as needed.,ALLERGIES: , None.,FINDINGS: , On exam today, the patient has good posture, good physique, good skin tone.  She is tanned.  Her lower abdomen has some excess adiposity.  There is some mild laxity of the lower abdominal skin.  Her umbilicus is oval shaped and of adequate caliber for a transumbilical breast augmentation.  There was no piercing in that region.  Her breasts are C shaped.  They are not ptotic.  They have good symmetry with no evidence of tubular breast deformity.  She has no masses or lesions noted.  The nipples are of appropriate size and shape for a woman of her age.  Her scar on her neck from her anterior cervical disk fusion is well healed.  Hopefully, our scars would be similar to this.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Hypomastia.  I think her general physique and body habitus would accommodate about 300 to 350 cubic centimeter implant nicely.  This would make her fill out her clothes much better, and I think transumbilical technique in her is a good option.  I have discussed with her the other treatment options, and she does not want scars around her breasts if at all possible.  I think her lower abdominal skin is of good tone.  I think suction lipectomy in this region would bring down her size and accentuate her waist nicely.  I am a little concerned about the lower abdominal skin laxity, and I will discuss with her further that in the near future if this continues to be a problem, she may need a mini tummy tuck.  I do think that a liposuction is a reasonable alternative and we could see how much skin tightening she gets after the adiposity is removed.  I will try to set this up in the near future.  I will try to set this up to get the instrumentation from the instrumentation rep for the transumbilical breast augmentation procedure.  Due to her neck issues, we may not be able to perform her surgery but I will check with Dr. X to see if she is comfortable giving her deep sedation and no general anesthetic with her neck being fused.cosmetic / plastic surgery, breast augmentation and liposuction, liposuction of her abdomen, transumbilical breast augmentation, cosmetic surgery, abdominal skin, breast augmentation, augmentation, liposuction, cosmetic, transumbilical, breast,"

After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained.  The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient.  This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes.  Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle.  A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.  Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified.  The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site.  The wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position.  There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone.  It was held in place with reduction forceps.  A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation.  It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula.  Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each.  The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length.  Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole.  The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length.  Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position.  There was no lateralization of the joints.  Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle.  Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus.  Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site.  The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures.  Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum.  The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus.  There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies.  Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire.  Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length.  These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position.  Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws.  They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint.  At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin.  A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril.  A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity.  This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.surgery, ankle fracture, dislocation, open reduction, internal fixation, orif, trimalleolar ankle fracture, cortical screw, cancellous screws, fracture site, fracture, ankle, malleolus, "
1,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Bassini inguinal herniorrhaphy.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with MAC anesthesia.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table.  The patient was sedated and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated.  The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors.  Care was taken not to injure the ilioinguinal nerve.  Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed.  Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery.,The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures.  The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery.,Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature.  The sac was excised and sent to Pathology.  The stump was examined and no bleeding was noted.  The ends of the suture were then cut, and the stump retracted back into the abdomen.,The floor of the inguinal canal was then strengthened by suturing the shelving edge of Poupart's ligament to the conjoined tendon using a 2-0 Prolene, starting at the pubic tubercle and running towards the internal ring.  In this manner, an internal ring was created that admitted just the tip of my smallest finger.,The Penrose drain was removed.  The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery.  The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior and superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.urology, ilioinguinal nerve, adherent cremasteric muscle, bassini inguinal herniorrhaphy, external oblique aponeurosis, inguinal herniorrhaphy, metzenbaum scissors, external ring, blunt dissection, cord structures, bovie electrocautery, inguinal, electrocautery"

2,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 57-year-old female being seen today for evaluation of pain and symptoms related to a recurrent bunion deformity in bilateral feet, right greater than left.  The patient states she is having increasing symptoms of pain and discomfort associated with recurrence of bunion deformity on the right foot and pain localized to the second toe and MTP joint of the right foot as well.  The patient had prior surgery performed approximately 13 years ago.  She states that since the time of the original surgery the deformity has slowly recurred, and she has noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes at the second and third toes of the left foot and involving the second toe of the right foot.  The patient is employed on her feet as a hospital employee and states that she does wear a functional orthotic which does provide some relief of forefoot pain although not complete.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY & REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  See Patient History sheet, which was reviewed with the patient and is signed in the chart.  Past medical history on the patient, past surgical history, current medications, drug-related allergies and social history have all been updated and reviewed, and enclosed in the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Physical exam reveals a pleasant, 57-year-old female who is 5 feet 4 inches and 150 pounds.  She has palpable pulses.  Neurologic sensation is intact.  Examination of the extremities shows the patient as having well-healed surgical sites from her arthroplasty, second digits bilaterally and prior bunionectomy.  There is a recurrence of bunion deformity noted on both great toes although the patient notes to have reasonably good range of movement.  She has particular pain in the second MTP joint of the right foot and demonstrates a mild claw-toe deformity of the second and third toes to the left foot, and to a lesser degree the second toe to the right.  Gait analysis:  The patient stands and walks with a rather severe pes planus and has generalized hypermobility noted in the feet.,X-RAY INTERPRETATION:,  X-rays taken today; three views to the right foot shows presence of internal K-wire and wire from prior bunionectomy.  Biomechanical analysis shows 15 degree intermetatarsal angle and approximately 45 degree hallux abducto valgus angle.  No evidence of arthrosis in the joint is noted.  Significant shift to the fibular sesamoid is present.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Recurrent bunion deformity, right forefoot.,2.  Pes planovalgus deformity, bilateral feet.,PLAN/TREATMENT:,1.  Today, we did review remaining treatment options with the patient including the feasibility of conservative versus surgical treatment.  The patient would require an open wedge osteotomy to reduce the intermetatarsal angle with the lateral release and a decompression osteotomy  at the second metatarsal.  Anticipated length of healing was noted for the patient as were potential risks and complications.  The patient ultimately would probably require surgery on her left foot at a later date as well.,2.

He presented several days later with headaches as well as a draining wound.  He was subsequently taken back for a dural repair.  For the last 10 to 11 days, he has been okay except for the last two days he has had increasing headaches, has nausea, vomiting, as well as positional migraines.  He has fullness in the back of his wound.  The patient's risks and benefits have been conferred him due to the fact that he does have persistent spinal leak.  The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration of his wound with dural repair with possible stabilization pending what we find intraoperatively.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #7.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  The patient was given intraoperative antibiotics.  The patient was rolled onto the OSI table in usual prone position and prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,Initially, a midline incision was made from the cephalad to caudad level.  Full-thickness skin flaps were developed.  It was seen immediately that there was large amount of copious fluid emanating from the wound, clear-like fluid, which was the cerebrospinal fluid.  Cultures were taken, aerobic, anaerobic, AFB, fungal.  Once this was done, the paraspinal muscles were affected from the posterior elements.  It was seen that there were no facet complexes on the right side at L4-L5 and L5-S1.  It was seen that the spine was listhesed at L5 and that the dural sac was pinched at the L4-5 level from the listhesis.  Once this was done; however, the fluid emanating from the dura could not be seen appropriately.  Complete laminectomy at L4 was performed as well extending the L5 laminectomy more to the left.  Complete laminectomy at L3 was done.  Once this was done within the subarticular recess on the right side at the L4 pedicle level, a rent in the dura was seen.  Once this was appropriately cleaned, the dural edges were approximated using a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  A Valsalva confirmed no significant lead after the repair was made.  There was a significant laterolisthesis at L4-L5 and due to the fact that there were no facet complexes at L5-S1 and L4-L5 on the right side as well as there was a significant concavity on the right L4-L5 disk space which was demonstrated from intraoperative x-rays and compared to preoperative x-rays, it was decided from an instrumentation.  The lateral pedicle screws were placed at L4, L5, and S1 using the standard technique of Magerl.  After this the standard starting point was made.  Trajectory was completed with gearshift and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  Once this was done, this was undertapped at 1 mm and resounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  The screws were subsequently placed.  Tricortical purchase was obtained at S1 ________ appropriate size screws.  Precontoured titanium rod was then appropriately planned and placed between the screws at L4, L5, and S1.  This was done on the right side first.  The screw was torqued at S1 appropriately and subsequently at L5.  Minimal compression was then placed between L5 and L4 to correct the concavity as well as laterolisthesis and the screw appropriately torqued at L4.  Neutral compression distraction was obtained on the left side.  Screws were torqued at L4, L5, and S1 appropriately.  Good placement was seen both in AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Laterolisthesis corrected appropriately at L4 and L5.,Posterior spinal fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements at L4-L5 and the sacral ala with a curette.  Once good bleeding subchondral bone was appreciated, the morselized bone from the laminectomy was morselized with corticocancellous bone chips together with demineralized bone matrix.  This was placed in the posterior lateral gutters.  DuraGen was then placed over the dural repair, and after this, fibrin glue was placed appropriately.  Deep retractors then removed from the confines of the wound.  Fascia was closed using interrupted Prolene running suture #1.  Once this was done, suprafascial drain was placed appropriately.  Subcutaneous tissues were opposed using a 2-0 Prolene suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  Wound was dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4 x 4's, and tape.  The drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was rolled on stretcher in usual supine position, extubated uneventfully, and taken back to the recovery room in a satisfactory stable condition.  No complications arose. "

No evidence of vegetations.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis July 27, 2007, that revealed multiple small cysts in the liver, the largest measuring 9 mm.  There were 2-3 additional tiny cysts in the right lobe.  The remainder of the CT scan was normal.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Briefly, the patient is a 26-year-old white female with a history of fevers.  For further details of the admission, please see the previously dictated history and physical.  ,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Gram-negative rod bacteremia.  The patient was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of endocarditis given the fact that she had fever, septicemia, and Osler nodes on her fingers.  The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram as an outpatient, which was equivocal, but a transesophageal echocardiogram here in the hospital was normal with no evidence of vegetations.  The microbiology laboratory stated that the Gram-negative rod appeared to be anaerobic, thus raising the possibility of organisms like bacteroides.  The patient does have a history of congenital genitourinary abnormalities which were surgically corrected before the fifth grade.  We did a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which only showed some benign appearing cysts in the liver.  There was nothing remarkable as far as her kidneys, ureters, or bladder were concerned.  I spoke with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases, and Dr. XYZ asked me to talk to the patient about any contact with animals, given the fact that we have had a recent outbreak of tularemia here in Utah.  Much to my surprise, the patient told me that she had multiple pet rats at home, which she was constantly in contact with.  I ordered tularemia and leptospirosis serologies on the advice of Dr. XYZ, and as of the day after discharge, the results of the microbiology still are not back yet.  The patient, however, appeared to be responding well to levofloxacin.  I gave her a 2-week course of 750 mg a day of levofloxacin, and I have instructed her to follow up with Dr. XYZ in the meantime.  Hopefully by then we will have a final identification and susceptibility on the organism and the tularemia and leptospirosis serologies will return.  A thought of ours was to add doxycycline, but again the patient clinically appeared to be responding to the levofloxacin.  In addition, I told the patient that it would be my recommendation to get rid of the rats.  I told her that if indeed the rats were carriers of infection and she received a zoonotic infection from exposure to the rats, that she could be in ongoing continuing danger and her children could also potentially be exposed to a potentially lethal infection.  I told her very clearly that she should, indeed, get rid of the animals.  The patient seemed reluctant to do so at first, but I believe with some coercion from her family, that she finally came to the realization that this was a recommendation worth following.,  ,DISPOSITION,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Activity is as tolerated.  Diet is as tolerated.,MEDICATIONS: , Levaquin 750 mg daily x14 days.,Followup is with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases.  I gave the patient the phone number to call on Monday for an appointment.  Additional followup is also with Dr. XYZ, her primary care physician.

1,"CIRCUMCISION - OLDER PERSON,OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture is used as a stay-stitch of the glans penis.  Next, incision line was marked circumferentially on the outer skin 3 mm below the corona.  The incision was then carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissues down to within a layer of * fascia.  Next, the foreskin was retracted.  Another circumferential incision was made 3 mm proximal to the corona.  The intervening foreskin was excised.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  Next, the skin was reapproximated at the frenulum with a U stitch of 5-0 chromic followed by stitches at 12, 3, and 9 o'clock.  The stitches were placed equal distance among these to reapproximate all the skin edges.  Next, good cosmetic result was noted with no bleeding at the end of the procedure.  Vaseline gauze, Telfa, and Elastoplast dressing was applied.  The stay-stitch was removed and pressure held until bleeding stopped.

The risks of the procedure were explained.  She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery.  General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted.  The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion.  A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope.  Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum.  A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region.  The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized.  The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated.  I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix.  The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.  I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry.  One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line.  We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites.  The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture.  The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.  No complications.  Minimal blood loss.  Specimen is the appendix.

1,"INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURES: , Impending open-heart surgery for atrial septectomy and bilateral bidirectional Glenn procedure.,The patient was already under general anesthesia in the operating room.  Antibiotic prophylaxis with cephazolin and gentamicin were already given.  A strict aseptic technique was used including use of gowns, mask, and gloves, etc.  The skin was cleansed with alcohol and then prepped with ChloraPrep solution.,PROCEDURE #1:,  Insertion of central venous line.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE #1: , Attention was directed to the right groin.  A Cook 4-French double-lumen 12-cm long central venous heparin-coated catheter kit was opened.  Using the 21-gauge needle that comes with this kit, the needle was inserted approximately 2 cm below the right inguinal ligament just medial to the pulsations of the femoral artery.  There was good venous blood return on the first try.  Using the Seldinger technique, the soft J-end of the wire was inserted through the needle without resistance approximately 15 cm.  It was then exchanged for a 5-French dilator followed by the 4-French double-lumen catheter and the wire was removed intact.  There was good blood return from both lumens, which were flushed with heparinized saline.  The catheter was sutured to the skin at three points with #4-0 silk for stabilization.,PROCEDURE #2:,  Insertion of arterial line.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE #2:,  Attention was directed to the left wrist, which was placed on wrist rest.  The Allen test was normal.  A Cook 2.5-French 5 cm long arterial catheter kit was opened.  A 22-gauge IV cannula was used to enter the artery, which was done on the first try with good pulsatile blood return.  Using the Seldinger technique, the catheter was exchanged for a 2.5-French catheter and the wire was removed intact.  There was pulsatile blood return and the catheter was flushed with heparinized saline solution.  It was sutured to the skin with #4-0 silk at three points for stabilization.,Both catheters functioned well throughout the procedure.  The distal circulation of the leg and the hand was intact immediately after insertion, approximately 20 minutes later, and at the end of the procedure.  There were no complications.,PROCEDURE #3: , Insertion of transesophageal echocardiography probe.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE #3: , The probe was inserted under direct vision because initially there was some resistance to insertion.  Under direct vision, using the #2 Miller blade, the upper esophageal opening was visualized and the probe was passed easily without resistance.  There was good visualization of the heart.

The patient presents to Labor and Delivery in active preterm labor and dilated approximately 4 to 6 cm.  The decision for C-section was made.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a supine position with a slight left lateral tilt and she was then prepped and draped in usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  The patient was then given general anesthesia and once this was completed, first knife was used to make a low transverse incision extending down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion with the use of curved Mayo scissors.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection was then completed both caudally and cephalically.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center and extended in a vertical fashion.  Peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  The bladder blade was put in place.  The bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum scissors and dissected away caudally.  The second knife was used to make a low transverse incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of the fetus.  The first fetus was vertex.  The fluid was clear.  The head was delivered followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut.  The newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician and nursery personnel.  The second fluid was ruptured.  It was the clear fluid as well.  The presenting part was brought down to be vertex.  The head was delivered followed by the rest of the body and the cord was doubly clamped and cut, and newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician in addition of the nursery personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained from both of the cords with careful identification of A and B. Once this was completed, the placenta was delivered and handed off for further inspection by Pathology.  At this time, it was noted at the uterus was adhered to the abdominal wall by approximately of 3 cm x 3 cm thick uterine adhesion and this was needed to be released by sharp dissection.  Then, there were multiple omental adhesions on the surface of the uterus itself.  This needed to be released as well as on the abdominal wall and then the uterus could be externalized.  The lining was wiped clean of any remaining blood and placental fragments and the edges of the uterus were grasped in four quadrants with Kocher and continuous locking stitch of 0 chromic was used to re-approximate the uterine incision, with the second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam underneath.  The right fallopian tube was grasped with a Babcock, it was doubly tied off with 0 chromic and the knuckle portion was then sharply incised and cauterized.  The same technique was completed on the left side with the knuckle portion cut off and cauterized as well.  The defect on the uterine surface was reinforced with 0 Vicryl in a baseball stitch to create adequate Hemostasis.  Interceed was placed over this area as well.  The abdominal cavity was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood.  The edges of the peritoneum were grasped with hemostats and a continuous locking stitch was used to re-approximate abdominal rectus muscles as well as the peritoneal edges.  The abdominal rectus muscle was irrigated.  The corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl started on both corners and overlapped on the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the subcutaneous tissue.  Skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Uterus was evacuated of any remaining blood vaginally.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.

Extensive lysis of adhesions.,3.  Right lower lobectomy.,4.  Mediastinal lymphadenectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After an adequate general anesthesia was given, she was placed in the left lateral decubitus and the right chest was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  Lateral thoracotomy was performed on the right side anterior to the tip of the scapula, and this was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue.  The latissimus dorsi muscle was partially transected and then the serratus was reflected anteriorly.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  A retractor was placed and then extensive number of adhesions between the lung and the pleura were lysed carefully with sharp and blunt dissection.  The right lower lobe was identified.  There was a large mass in the superior segment of the lobe, which was very close to the right upper lobe, and because of the adhesions, it could not be told if the tumor was extending into the right upper lobe, but it appeared that it did not.  Dissection was then performed at the lower lobe of the fissure, and a GIA stapler was placed through here to separate the tumor from the upper lobe including a small segment of the upper lobe with the lower lobe.  Then, dissection of the hilum was performed, and the branches of the pulmonary artery to the lower lobe were ligated with #2-0 silk freehand ties proximally and distally and #3-0 silk transfixion stitches and then transected.  The inferior pulmonary vein was dissected after dividing the ligament, and it was stapled proximally and distally with a TA30 stapler and then transected.  Further dissection of the fissure allowed for its completion with a GIA stapler and then the bronchus was identified and dissected.  The bronchus was stapled with a TA30 bronchial stapler and then transected, and the specimen was removed and sent to the Pathology Department for frozen section diagnosis.  The frozen section diagnosis was that of non-small cell carcinoma, bronchial margins free and pleural margins free.  The mediastinum was then explored.  No nodes were identified around the pulmonary ligament or around the esophagus.  Subcarinal nodes were dissected, and hemostasis was obtained with clips.  The space below and above the osseous was opened, and the station R4 nodes were dissected.  Hemostasis was obtained with clips and with electrocautery.  All nodal tissue were sent to Pathology as permanent specimen.  Following this, the chest was thoroughly irrigated and aspirated.  Careful hemostasis was obtained and a couple of air leaks were controlled with #6-0 Prolene sutures.  Then, two #28 French chest tubes were placed in the chest, one posteriorly and one anteriorly, and secured to the skin with #2-0 nylon stitches.  The incision was then closed with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl pericostal stitches.  A running #1 PDS on the muscle layer, a running 2-0 PDS in the subcutaneous tissue, and staples on the skin.

3,"XYZ,RE:  ABC,MEDICAL RECORD#:  123,Dear Dr. XYZ:,I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today.  He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.,Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.,After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.,From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him.  This is very worrisome.  Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.,Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  It is not that he does not want treatment, however.  Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.,While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.,I will keep you apprised of followups.  If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.,Sincerely,hematology - oncology, neuro oncology, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic, oncology, radiation, astrocytoma"

On physical exam, the patient was found to have grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support, and history of hysterectomy.  The patient had good anterior support at the bladder.  Options were discussed such as watchful waiting, pessary, repair with and without mesh, and closing of the vagina (colpocleisis) were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, morbidity, and mortality of the procedure were discussed., ,Risk of infection and abscess formation were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  Risk of retention and incontinence were discussed.  Consent was obtained through the family members.,DETAILS OF THE OR:,  The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had a Foley catheter placed.  The posterior side of the rectocele was visualized with grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support.  A 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was applied for posterior hydrodissection, which was very difficult to do due to the significant scarring of the posterior part.  Attempts were made to lift the vaginal mucosa off of the rectum, which was very, very difficult to do at this point due to the patient's overall poor medical condition in terms of poor mobility and significant scarring.  Discussion was done with the family in the waiting area regarding simply closing the vagina and doing a colpocleisis since the patient is actually inactive.  Family agreed that she is not active and they rather not have any major invasive procedure especially in light of scarring and go ahead and perform the colpocleisis.  Oral consent was obtained from the family and her surgery was preceded.  The vaginal mucosa was denuded off using electrocautery and Metzenbaum scissors.  Using 0 Vicryl, 2 transverse longitudinal stitches were placed to bring the anterior and the posterior part of the vagina together and was started at the apex and was brought all the way out to the introitus.  The vaginal mucosa was pretty much completely closed off all the way up to the introitus.  Indigo carmine was given.  Cystoscopy revealed there was a good efflux of urine from both of the ureteral openings.  There was no injury to the bladder or kinking of the ureteral openings.  The bladder was normal.  Rectal exam was normal at the end of the colpocleisis repair.  There was good hemostasis., ,At the end of the procedure, Foley was removed and the patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.surgery, vault prolapse, rectocele repair, rectocele, vaginal mass, metzenbaum scissors, ureteral openings, vaginal mucosa, colpocleisis, vaginal, infection,"

The patient is also diabetic.  The patient had a workup for her gallbladder, which showed evidence of biliary dyskinesia.  The patient was then scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient's abdomen was explored.  There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding or masses.  The abdomen was otherwise within normal limits.  The gallbladder was easily visualized.  There was an intrahepatic gallbladder.  There was no evidence of any inflammatory change.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought into the operating suite.,After general endotracheal intubation, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Next, an infraumbilical incision was made with a #10 scalpel.  The skin was elevated with towel clips and a Veress needle was inserted.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg of pressure.  The Veress needle was removed and a #10 blade trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The laparoscope was then inserted through this #10 port and the abdomen was explored.  There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding.  The peritoneum was smooth.  The gallbladder was intrahepatic somewhat.  No evidence of any inflammatory change.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the abdomen.  Next, attention was made to placing the epigastric #10 port, which again was placed under direct visualization without difficulty.  The two #5 ports were placed, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior axillary line again in similar fashion under direct visualization.  The gallbladder was then grasped out at its fundus, elevated to patient's left shoulder.  Using a curved dissector, the cystic duct was identified and freed up circumferentially.  Next, an Endoclip was used to distal and proximal to the gallbladder, Endoshears were used in between to transect the cystic duct.  The cystic artery was transected in similar fashion.  Attention was next made in removing the gallbladder from the liver bed using electrobovie cautery and spatulated tip.  It was done without difficulty.  The gallbladder was then grasped via the epigastric port and removed without difficulty and sent to pathology.  Hemostasis was maintained using electrobovie cautery.  The liver bed was then copiously irrigated and aspirated.  All the fluid and air was then aspirated and then all ports were removed under direct visualization.  The two #10 ports were then closed in the fascia with #0 Vicryl and a UR6 needle.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  0.25% Marcaine was injected and Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition.gastroenterology, electrobovie cautery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, biliary colic, biliary dyskinesia, biliary, laparoscopic, cholecystectomy, colic, abdomen, dyskinesia, gallbladder"

Following induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery.  Table was turned.  The right shoulder roll was placed.  The head was turned to the left and rested on a doughnut.  The scalp was shaved, and then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Incisions were marked along a putative right frontotemporal craniotomy frontally and over the parietal boss.  The parietal boss incision was opened.  It was about an inch and a half in length.  It was carried down to the skull.  Self-retaining retractor was placed.  A bur hole was now fashioned with the perforator.  This was widened with a 2-mm Kerrison punch.  The dura was now coagulated with bipolar electrocautery.  It was opened in a cruciate-type fashion.  The dural edges were coagulated back to the bony edges.  There was egress of a large amount of liquid.  Under pressure, we irrigated for quite sometime until irrigation was returning mostly clear.  A subdural drain was now inserted under direct vision into the subdural space and brought out through a separate stab incision.  It was secured with a 3-0 nylon suture.  The area was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was subsequently returned back to anesthesia.  He was extubated in the operating room, and transported to PACU in satisfactory condition.surgery, hematoma, burr hole, craniotomy, frontotemporal, frontotemporal craniotomy, subdural, subdural drain, subdural hematoma, subdural space"
4,"CC:, Headache and diplopia.,HX:, This 39 y/o African American female began experiencing severe constant pressure pain type headaches beginning the last week of 8/95. The pain localized to bifronto-temporal regions of the head and did not radiate. There was no associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia or phonophobia. The HA's occurred daily; and throughout daylight hours. They diminished at bedtime, but occasionally awakened her in the morning.,Several days following the onset of her HA's, she began experiencing numbness and tingling about the right side of her face. These symptoms improved, but did not completely resolved.,Several days after the onset of facial paresthesias, she began to experience binocular horizontal diplopia. The diplopia resolved when covering either eye, and worsened upon looking toward the right. Coincidentally, she began veering toward the right when walking. She denied any weakness.

No adnexal masses, however, were appreciated on the bimanual exam.  Laparoscopically, the patient had numerous omental adhesions to the vesicouterine peritoneum in the fundus of the uterus.  There were also adhesions to the left fallopian tube and the right fallopian tube.  There was a copious amount of blood in the abdomen approximately 2 liters of clotted and unclotted blood.  There was some questionable gestational tissue ________ on the left sacrospinous ligament.  There was an apparent rupture and bleeding ectopic pregnancy in the isthmus portion of the right fallopian tube.,PROCEDURE:,  After an informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and the general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  A weighted speculum was then placed in the vagina.  The interior wall of vagina elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size #20 Hank and then a sharp curettage was performed obtaining a moderate amount of decidual appearing tissue and the tissue was then sent to pathology.  At this point, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior cervix and vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention was then turned to the abdomen.  The surgeons all are removed the dirty gloves in the previous portion of the case.  Next, a 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and a Veress needle was inserted through this incision.  Next, a syringe was used to inject normal saline into the Veress needle.  The normal saline was seen to drop freely, so a Veress needle was connected to the CO2 gas which was started at its lowest setting.  The gas was seen to flow freely with normal resistance, so the CO2 gas was advanced to a higher setting.  The abdomen was insufflated to an adequate distension.  Once an adequate distention was reached, the CO2 gas was disconnected.  The Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was placed.  The introducer was removed and the trocar was connected to the CO2 gas and a camera was inserted.  Next, a 1 cm incision was made in the midline approximately two fingerbreadths below the pubic symphysis after transilluminating with the camera.  A Veress needle and a step sheath were inserted through this incision.  Next, the Veress needle was removed and a size #5 trocar was inserted under direct visualization.  Next a size #5 port was placed approximately five fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus in a similar fashion.  A size #12 port was placed in a similar fashion approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus and also under direct visualization.  The laparoscopic dissector was inserted through the suprapubic port and this was used to dissect the omental adhesions bluntly from the vesicouterine peritoneum and the bilateral fallopian tubes.  Next, the Dorsey suction irrigator was used to copiously irrigate the abdomen.  Approximate total of 3 liters of irrigation was used and the majority of all blood clots and free blood was removed from the abdomen.,Once the majority of blood was cleaned from the abdomen, the ectopic pregnancy was easily identified and the end of the fallopian tube was grasped with the grasper from the left upper quadrant and the LigaSure device was then inserted through the right upper quadrant with # 12 port.  Three bites with the LigaSure device were used to transect the mesosalpinx inferior to the fallopian tube and then transect the fallopian tube proximal to the ectopic pregnancy.  An EndoCatch bag was then placed to the size #12 port and this was used to remove the right fallopian tube and ectopic pregnancy.  This was then sent to the pathology.  Next, the right mesosalpinx and remains of the fallopian tube were examined again and they were seemed to be hemostatic.  The abdomen was further irrigated.  The liver was examined and appeared to be within normal limits.  At this point, the two size #5 ports and a size #12 port were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was then removed.  The CO2 gas was disconnected and the abdomen was desufflated.  The introducer was then replaced in a size #11 port and the whole port and introducer was removed as a single unit.  All laparoscopic incisions were closed with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  They were then steri-stripped and bandaged appropriately.  At the end of the procedure, the uterine manipulator was removed from the cervix and the patient was taken to Recovery in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She was discharged home with a postoperative hemoglobin of 8.9.  She was given iron 325 mg to be taken twice a day for five months and Darvocet-N 100 mg to be taken every four to six hours for pain.

Right middle lobe bronchoalveolar lavage.,b.  Right upper lobe bronchoalveolar lavage.,c.  Right lower lobe transbronchial biopsies.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,Samples include bronchoalveolar lavage of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe and transbronchial biopsies of the right lower lobe.,INDICATION:  ,The patient with a history of TB and caseating granulomata on open lung biopsy with evidence of interstitial lung disease and question tuberculosis.,PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was brought to the Bronchoscopy Suite with appropriate isolation related to ______ precautions.  The patient had appropriate oxygen, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate monitoring applied and monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula was applied to the nasopharynx with 100% saturations achieved.  Topical anesthesia with 10 cc of 4% Xylocaine was applied to the right nares and oropharynx.  Subsequent to this, the patient was premedicated with 50 mg of Demerol and then Versed 1 mg sequentially for a total of 2 mg.  With this, adequate consciousness sedation was achieved.  3 cc of 4% viscous Xylocaine was applied to the right nares.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the right nares into the nasopharynx and oropharynx.,The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and showed mild erythema, mild edema, otherwise negative.,There was normal vocal cord motion without masses or lesions.  Additional topical anesthesia with 2% Xylocaine was applied to the larynx and subsequently throughout the tracheobronchial tree for a total of 18 cc.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea.  The trachea showed mild evidence of erythema and moderate amounts of clear frothy secretions.  These were suctioned clear.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the carina, which was sharp.  Then advanced into the left main stem and each segment, subsegement in the left upper lingula and lower lobe was visualized.  There was mild tracheobronchitis with mild friability throughout.  There was modest amounts of white secretion.  There were no other findings including evidence of mass, anatomic distortions, or hemorrhage.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and advanced into the right mainstem.  Again, each segment and subsegment was well visualized.  The right upper lobe anatomy showed some segmental distortion with dilation and irregularities both at the apical region as well as in the subsegments of the anteroapical and posterior segments.  No specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right.  There was mild tracheal bronchitis with friability.  Upon coughing, there was punctate hemorrhage.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the bronchus intermedius and the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.  These again had no other anatomic lesions identified.  The bronchoscope was then wedged in the right middle lobe and bronchoalveolar samples were obtained.  The bronchoscope was withdrawn and the area was suctioned clear.  The bronchoscope was then advanced into the apical segment of the right upper lobe and the bronchioalveolar lavage again performed.  Samples were taken and the bronchoscope was removed suctioned the area clear.  The bronchoscope was then re-advanced into the right lower lobe and multiple transbronchial biopsies were taken under fluoroscopic guidance in the posterior and lateral segments of the right lower lobe.  Minimal hemorrhage was identified and suctioned clear without difficulty.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the mainstem.  The area was suctioned clear.  Fluoroscopy revealed no evidence of pneumothorax.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without evidence of desaturation or complications.surgery, bronchoalveolar, lavage, lobe, tracheobronchitis, granulomatous, miliary tb, tb, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, bronchoscope, flexible, fiberoptic, transbronchial, biopsies, bronchoscopy, oropharynx,"

The patient was placed in posterior splint and followed up at ABC orthopedics for further care.,PROCEDURE:,  After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, the operative surgeon, Department Of Anesthesia, and nursing staff.  While in this hospital, the Department Of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient was then transferred to the operative table and placed in the prone position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.,A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  Left lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Once this was done, the left lower extremity was elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg and kept up for a total of 40 minutes.  After all bony and soft tissue land marks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made paramedial to the Achilles tendon from its insertion proximal.  Careful dissection was then taken down to the level of the peritenon.  Once this was reached, full thickness flaps were performed medially and laterally.  Next, retractor was placed.  All neurovascular structures were protected.  A longitudinal incision was then made in the peritenon and opened up exposing the tendon.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.  The plantar tendon was noted to be intact.  The tendon was debrided at this time of hematoma as well as frayed tendon.  Wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Most of the ankle appeared that there was sufficient tendon links in order to do a primary repair.  Next #0 PDS on a taper needle was selected and a Krackow stitch was then performed.  Two sutures were then used and tied individually ________ from the tendon.  The tendon came together very well and with a tight connection.  Next, a #2-0 Vicryl suture was then used to close the peritenon over the Achilles tendon.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated and dried.  A #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to close the skin and subcutaneous fashion followed by #4-0 suture in the subcuticular closure on the skin.  Steri-Strips were then placed over the wound and the sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, Kerlix roll, sterile Kerlix and a short length fiberglass cast in a plantar position.  At this time, the Department of anesthesia reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Status post-respiratory arrest.,2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,3. Congestive heart failure.,4. History of coronary artery disease.,5. History of hypertension.,SUMMARY:,  The patient is a 49-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in respiratory distress, and had to be intubated shortly after admission to the emergency room. The patient’s past history is notable for a history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions in 1995 and 1999. The patient has recently been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been smoking up until three to four months previously. On the day of admission, the patient had the sudden onset of severe dyspnea and called an ambulance. The patient denied any gradual increase in wheezing, any increase in cough, any increase in chest pain, any increase in sputum prior to the onset of his sudden dyspnea.,ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: Showed a well-developed, slightly obese man who was in extremis.,NECK: Supple, with no jugular venous distension.,HEART: Showed tachycardia without murmurs or gallops.,PULMONARY: Status showed decreased breath sounds, but no clear-cut rales or wheezes.,EXTREMITIES: Free of edema.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient was admitted to the Special Care Unit and intubated. He received intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin. He received intravenous diuretic therapy. He received hand-held bronchodilator therapy. The patient also was given intravenous steroid therapy with Solu-Medrol. The patient’s course was one of gradual improvement, and after approximately three days, the patient was extubated. He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patient’s overall clinical picture suggested that he had a,significant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular; his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further management on an outpatient basis.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA:,  The patient’s admission laboratory data was notable for his initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103. The patient’s electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The patent’s CBC showed a white count of 24,000, with 56% neutrophils and 3% bands.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient was discharged home.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:,  His diet was to be a 2 grams sodium, 1800 calorie ADA diet.

4,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma, endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus, harvesting of dermal fascia abdominal fat graft, placement of abdominal fat graft into sella turcica, reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm, repair of nasal septal deviation, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique, and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This man has undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resections of his tumor, which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma.  He did not return for followup or radiotherapy as instructed, and the tumor has regrown.  For this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove as much tumor as possible.  The high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory was made clear to him.  Many risks including CSF leak and blindness were discussed in detail.  After clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The back was prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.,A 14-gauge Tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space.  Clear and colorless CSF issued forth.  A catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle was removed.  The catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.,This no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas.  Via injections through the lumbar drain, one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor.  This improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.,The patient was then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest was affixed.  He was placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The fluoroscope C-arm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection.  The metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope.  The oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the abdominal region, and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was carefully closed in layers.,I then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril.  The middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.  Needle Bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium.  The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid.  I entered into the sphenoid.,There was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and I slowly and carefully worked through all this.  I identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which was very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which I exposed the very medial portion of.  The opening was wide until I had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.,The operating microscope was then utilized.  Working under magnification, I used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.,The dura was then carefully opened in the midline, and I immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma.  A frozen section was obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features.,Slowly and meticulously, I worked to remove the tumor.  I used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free.  The tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic.,Slowly and carefully, I systematically entered the sellar contents until I could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right.  There appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left.  It was consistent with what we saw on the MRI imaging.,The portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter.  A large amount of this was removed.  There was a CSF leak, as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.,Under high magnification, I actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor.  While there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus.  In fact, I reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well.,I reasoned that I had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression.  Attention was therefore turned to closure.,The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  I asked Anesthesiology to perform a Valsalva maneuver, and there was no evidence of bleeding.,Attention was turned to closure and reconstruction.  I placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air.  Using a polypropylene insert, I reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm.,DuraSeal was placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and DuraSeal.,I inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation.  The middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position.  There was no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open nasal packing was required.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct, and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of tumor. "

The patient states she is significant for a previous right ectopic pregnancy diagnosed in 08/08 and treated appropriately and adequately with methotrexate.  Evaluation in the emergency room reveals a second right ectopic pregnancy.  Her beta quant was found to be approximately 13,000.  The ultrasound showed right adnexal mass with crown-rump length measuring consistent with an 8 weeks gestation and a moderate free fluid in the abdominal cavity.  Given these findings as well as physical examination findings a recommendation was made proceed with an exploratory laparotomy and right salpingectomy.  The procedure was discussed with the patient in detail including risks of bleeding, infection, injury to surrounding organs and possible need for further surgery.  Informed consult was obtained prior to proceeding with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was administered without difficulty.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia using the Bovie.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  Kocher clamps were used to grasp the superior aspect of the fascial incision, which was elevated and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly using Mayo scissors, attention was then turned to the inferior aspect, which was grasped with Kocher clamps, elevated and the underlying rectus muscles dissected up bluntly using Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscles were dissected in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified using blunt dissection and entered in this manner and extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  At this time, the blood found in the abdomen was suctioned.  The bowel was packed with moist laparotomy sponge.  The right ectopic pregnancy was identified.  The fallopian tube was clamped x2, excised, and ligated x2 using 0-Vicryl suture.  Hemostasis was visualized.

General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. He was turned into the prone position on the operating table and positioned in the modified knee-chest position with Andrews frame being used. Care was taken to protect pressure points. The back was shaved, scrubbed with Betadine scrub, rinsed with alcohol, and prepped with DuraPrep, and draped in the usual sterile fashion with Ioban drape being used. A midline skin incision was made, excising scar from previous surgery. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery technique. The lumbosacral fascia was split to the left of the spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection of the spinous process and lamina, area of previous laminotomy was identified. Cross-table lateral was also made to confirm position. The scar was then loosened from the inferior portion of 4, superior of L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. I did identify normal dura. The scar was then lysed from the medial wall. Dura and nerve root were identified and protected with nerve root retractor. The bulging disk fragment was still contained under the longitudinal ligament. A rent was made with the Penfield and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disk space was then entered with a cruciate cut in the annulus, with additional nuclear material being received. When no other fragments could be removed from the disk space, no other fragments were felt in the central canal under the longitudinal ligament, and a Murphy ball could be passed through the foramen without evidence of compression, the decompression was complete. Check was made for CSF leakage, and no evidence of significant epidural bleeding was present. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution. Twenty milligrams of Depo-Medrol was placed over the dura and nerve root. A free fat graft from the subcutaneous tissue was then placed over the dura. Closure was obtained with the lumbosacral fascia being reapproximated with #1, running, Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous closure was obtained in layers with 2-0, running, Vicryl suture. Skin closure was obtained with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular suture. Proxi-Strips and sterile dressing was applied.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Term pregnancy at 40 and 3/7th weeks.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Spontaneous vaginal delivery.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 36-year-old African-American female who is a G-2, P-2-0-0-2 with an EDC of 08/30/2003.  She is blood type AB -ve with antibody screen negative and is also rubella immune, VDRL nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and HIV nonreactive.  She does have a history of sickle cell trait.  She presented to Labor and Delivery Triage at 40 and 3/7th weeks gestation with complaint of contractions every ten minutes.  She also stated that she has lost her mucous plug.  She did have fetal movement, noted no leak of fluid, did have some spotting.  On evaluation of triage, she was noted to be contracting approximately every five minutes and did have discomfort with her contractions.  She was evaluated by sterile vaginal exam and was noted to be 4 cm dilated, 70% effaced, and -3 station.  This was a change from her last office exam, at which she was 1 cm to 2 cm dilated.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient was admitted to Labor and Delivery for expected management of labor and AROM was performed and the amniotic fluid was noted to be meconium stained.  After her membranes were ruptured, contractions did increase to every two to three minutes as well as the intensity increased.  She was given Nubain for discomfort with good result.,She had a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a live born female at 11:37 with meconium stained fluid as noted from ROA position.  After controlled delivery of the head, tight nuchal cord was noted, which was quickly double clamped and cut and the shoulders and body were delivered without difficulty.  The infant was taken to the awaiting pediatrician.  Weight was 2870 gm, length was 51 cm.  The Apgars were 6 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.  There was initial neonatal depression, which was treated by positive pressure ventilation and the administration of Narcan.,Spontaneous delivery of an intact placenta with a three-vessel cord was noted at 11:45.  On examination, there were no noted perineal abrasions or lacerations.  On vaginal exam, there were no noted cervical or vaginal sidewall lacerations.  Estimated blood loss was less than 250 cc.  Mother and infant are in recovery doing well at this time.obstetrics / gynecology, roa position, arom, labor and delivery, spontaneous vaginal delivery, term pregnancy, contracting, meconium, lacerations, pregnancy, contractions, vaginal, "

2,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Acute deep venous thrombosis, right lower extremity with bilateral pulmonary embolism, on intravenous heparin complicated with acute renal failure for evaluation.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,Briefly, this is a 36-year-old robust Caucasian gentleman with no significant past medical or surgical history, who works as a sales representative, doing a lot of traveling by plane and car and attending several sales shows, developed acute shortness of breath with an episode of syncope this weekend and was brought in by paramedics to Hospital.  A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism.  A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct.  Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today.  He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow.  Reviewing his history, there is no family members with hypercoagulable state or prior history of any thrombotic complication.  He denies any recent injury to his lower extremity and in fact denied any calf pain or swelling.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Unremarkable.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married and has 1 son.  He has a brother who is healthy.  There is no history of tobacco use or alcohol use.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  No family history of hypercoagulable condition.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Advil p.r.n.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Essentially unremarkable except for sudden onset dyspnea on easy exertion complicated with episode of syncope.  He denied any hemoptysis.  He denied any calf swelling or pain.  Lately, he has been traveling and has been sitting behind a desk for a long period of time.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  He is a robust young gentleman, awake, alert, and hemodynamically stable.,HEENT:  Sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae normal.  Oropharynx normal.,NECK:  No adenopathy or thyromegaly.  No jugular venous distention.,HEART:  Regular.,LUNGS:  Bilateral air entry.,ABDOMEN:  Obese and benign.,EXTREMITIES:  No calf swelling or calf tenderness appreciated.,SKIN:  No petechiae or ecchymosis.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.,LABORATORY FINDINGS:,  Blood count obtained showed a white count of 16.8, hemoglobin 14.8 g percent, hematocrit 44.6%, MCV 94, and platelet count 209,000.  Liver profile normal.  Thyroid study revealed a TSH of 1.3.  Prothrombin time/INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 78.6 seconds.  Renal function, BUN 44 and creatinine 5.7.  Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 65%, no intramural thrombus noted.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Bilateral pulmonary embolism, most consistent with emboli from right lower extremity, on intravenous heparin, rule out hereditary hypercoagulable state.,2.  Leukocytosis, most likely leukemoid reaction secondary to acute pulmonary embolism/renal infarction, doubt presence of myeloproliferative disorder.,3.  Acute renal failure secondary to embolic right renal infarction.,4.  Obesity.,PLAN: , From hematologic standpoint, we will await hypercoagulable studies, which have all been sent on admission to see if a hereditary component is at play.  For now, we will continue intravenous heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with Coumadin.  In view of worsening renal function, may need temporary hemodialysis until renal function improves.  I discussed at length with the patient's wife at the bedside.nan"
1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Incidental right adnexal mass on ultrasound.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Complex left ovarian cyst.,2.  Bilateral complex adnexae.,3.  Bilateral hydrosalpinx.,4.  Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease.,5.  Massive pelvic adhesions.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Dilation and curettage (D&C).,2.  Laparoscopy.,3.  Enterolysis.,4.  Lysis of the pelvic adhesions.,5.  Left salpingo-oophorectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , Endometrial curettings and left ovarian mass.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 100 cc.,DRAINS:,  None.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the patient has a slightly enlarged, anteverted, freely mobile uterus with an enlarged left adnexa.  Laparoscopically, the patient has massive pelvic adhesions with completely obliterated posterior cul-de-sac and adnexa.,No adnexal structures were initially able to be visualized until after the lysis of adhesions.  Eventually we found a normal appearing right ovary, severely scarred right and left fallopian tubes, and a enlarged complex cystic left ovary.  There was a normal-appearing appendix and liver, and the vesicouterine junction appeared within normal limits.  There were significant adhesions from the small bowel to the bilateral adnexa in the posterior surface of the uterus.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina and anterior wall of the vagina was elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 12 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size #20 Hank.  Next a Telfa pad was placed on the weighted speculum and a short curettage was performed obtaining a large amount of endometrial tissue.  Next, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  At this point, the vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention was turned to the abdomen where an approximately 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to the umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and Veress needle was inserted through this incision.  Small amount of normal saline was injected into Veress needle and seemed to drop freely.  So, the Veress needle was connected to he CO2 gas, which was started at the lower setting.  It was seen to flow freely with a normal resistance so the gas was advanced to the higher setting.  The abdomen was then insufflated to an adequate distention.  Next, the Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was inserted.  Next, the introducer was removed from the trocar and the laparoscope was inserted through this port and the port was also connected to the CO2 gas.  At this point, the initial operative findings were seen.  Next, a size #5 step trocar was inserted approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis in the midline.  This was done by making a 1 cm incision with the skin knife, introducing a Veress needle with Ethicon sheet, and the Veress needle was then removed and the #5 port was introduced under direct visualization.  A size #5 port was also placed approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus in a similar manner also under direct visualization.  A blunt probe was inserted suprapubically along with a grasper in the right upper quadrant.  These were used to see the above operative findings.  Next, a size #12 mm port was introduced approximately seven fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus under direct visualization.  Through this, a Harmonic scalpel was inserted.,The Harmonic scalpel along with the grasper was used to meticulously address the adhesions along the right adnexa in the posterior cul-de-sac.  Care was taken at all times to avoid the bowel and the ureters.  The fallopian tubes appeared massively scarred and completely obliterated from disease.  After the right adnexa had been freed to the point where we could visualize the ovary and the posterior cul-de-sac was clearing off then we could visualize the uterosacral ligaments.  Attention was turned to the left adnexa, which appeared to contain a cystic structure, but it was unclear at the beginning of the procedure what the structure was.  Adhesions were carefully taken down from the bowel to the left fallopian tube and ovary, and sidewall.  The adhesions were then carefully removed from the inferior aspect of the ovary also with the Harmonic scalpel.  At intermittent points throughout the procedure, the suction irrigator was used to irrigate and suck blood and irrigation out of the pelvis to watch for any bleeding.  At this point, the Harmonic scalpel was removed and another laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was inserted and this was used to aspirate approximately 30 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the cystic structure.  Next, the needle was removed and the ligature device was inserted.  This was used to clamp across the fallopian tube initially and then after the fallopian tube was ligated, the uterovarian ligament was clamped and ligated with the ligature device.  Next, the fallopian tube was removed from the ovary with the ligature device in approximately 3 clamping and ligations.  Then, the attention was turned to the inferior aspect of the ovary.  First the infundibulopelvic ligament was identified, clamped with a ligature device, and ligated.  Next, the ovary was bluntly dissected from the ovarian fossa with attention to the left ureter.  Next, the ligature device was used to clamp and ligate the broad ligament immediately inferior to the ovary across.  Then the ovary was completely bluntly dissected out of the ovarian fossa and completely separated from the pelvis.  This was grasped with a clamp.  The ligature device was removed from the #12 and a EndoCatch bag was inserted to the size #12 port.  The left ovary was placed in this EndoCatch bag, which was then removed along with the whole port from the left upper quadrant.  Next, the pelvis was copiously irrigated and suctioned of all blood and extra fluid.  At this point, the remaining two size #5 ports were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was desufflated.  Next, an introducer was replaced on a #11 port.  The #11 port was removed.  Next, the fascia in the left upper quadrant port was identified and grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and closed with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl on a UR-6 needle.  Next, all skin incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  The incisions were cleaned, injected with 0.25% Marcaine, and then adjusted with Steri-Strips and bandage appropriately.,The patient was taken from the operating room in stable condition and should be observed overnight in the hospital.nan"
2,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 53-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents to the clinic for further evaluation of diplopia.  He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009.  He had double vision.  He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated.  The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour.  He was able to drive.  However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again.  Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe.  He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation.  He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation.  He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm.  The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia.  Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together.  He still does not drive.  He also is not working due to the double vision.  There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision.  More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain.  It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid.  He denies any dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological symptoms.,There is a neurology consultation in the computer system.  Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department.  He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side.  MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative.  He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal.  His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.,At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis.  He had left gaze diplopia.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal.  According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil.  There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities.  I do not have the official ophthalmologic consultation available to me today.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient denies any previous past medical history.  He currently does not have a primary care physician as he is uninsured.,MEDICATIONS:,  He does not take any medications.,ALLERGIES: , He has no known drug allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with his wife.  He was an IT software developer, but he has been out of work for several months.  He smokes less than a pack of cigarettes daily.  He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.,FAMILY HISTORY: , His mother died of a stroke in her 90s.  His father had colon cancer.  He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  BP 124/76nan"
4,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bunion, left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,Bunion, left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Bunionectomy with first metatarsal osteotomy base wedge type with internal screw fixation.,2.  Akin osteotomy with internal wire fixation of left foot.,HISTORY: , This 19-year-old Caucasian female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states she has had worsening bunion deformity for as long as she could not remember.  She does have a history of Charcot-Marie tooth disease and desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in a Mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating field.  The stockinette was reflected, the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal.,The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone.  Capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head.  At this time, the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white, shiny, and healthy cartilage.  There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  Attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release.  The abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected.  The lateral capsulotomy was performed.  The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  Attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  Intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal.,At this time, a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1.5 cm.  The capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified.  A 0.45 K-wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface.  This K-wire was used as an access guide for a Juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy.  The sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial.  The osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges.  The cortical hinge was maintained.  A 0.27 x 24 mm screw was then inserted in a standard AO fashion.  At this time, there was noted to be tight compression of the osteotomy site.  A second 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted more distally in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  The ________ angle was noted to be significantly released.  Reciprocating rasp was then used to smoothen any remaining sharp edges.  The 0.45 k-wire was removed.  The foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux.  At this time, it was incised to perform an Akin osteotomy.,Original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm.  The incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx.  Again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  An Akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial.  After where the bone was resected, it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge.  At 1.5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire.  The #28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight ________ osteotomy site was noted.  The remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole.  The area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site.  A running #5-0 subcuticular stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  Posterior splint was then placed on the patient in the operating room.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred back to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  The patient was given postoperative instructions to be strictly nonweightbearing on the left foot.  The patient was given postop pain prescriptions for Vicodin and instructed to take one q.4-6h. p.r.n. for pain as well as Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. q. b.i.d.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office in four to five days as directed.podiatry, bunionectomy, akin osteotomy, internal wire fixation, internal screw fixation, osteotomy, metatarsal, metatarsal osteotomy, extensor digitorum, drill hole, osteotomy site, foot"

Preoperative MRI scan showed evidence of herniated nucleus pulposus at C5-C6 and C6-C7 on the left.  The patient has failed epidural steroid injections.  Risks and benefits of the above procedure were discussed with the patient including bleeding, infection, muscle loss, nerve damage, paralysis, and death.,OPERATIVE REPORT: , The patient was taken to the OR and placed in the supine position.  After general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient's neck was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A horizontal incision was made on the left side of the neck at the level of the C6 vertebral body.  It was taken down through the subcutaneous tissues exposing the platysmus muscle.  The platysmus muscle was incised along the skin incision and the deep cervical fascia was bluntly dissected down to the anterior cervical spine.  An #18 gauge needle was placed in the C5-C6 interspace and the intraoperative x-ray confirmed that this was the appropriate level.  Next, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally on both the right and left side, and then a complete anterior cervical discectomy was performed.  The disk was very degenerated and brown in color.  There was an acute disk herniation through posterior longitudinal ligament.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and a bilateral foraminotomy was performed.  Approximately, 5 mm of the nerve root on both the right and left side was visualized.  A ball-ended probe could be passed up the foramen.  Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo.  The end plates of C5 and C6 were prepared using a high-speed burr and a 6-mm lordotic machined allograft was malleted into place.  There was good bony apposition both proximally and distally.  Next, attention was placed at the C6-C7 level.  Again, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally and a complete anterior cervical discectomy at C6-C7 was performed.  The disk was degenerated and there was acute disk herniation in the posterior longitudinal ligament on the left.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed.  A bilateral foraminotomy was performed.  Approximately, 5 mm of the C7 nerve root was visualized on both sides.  A micro nerve hook was able to be passed up the foramen easily.  Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo.  The end plates at C6-C7 were then prepared using a high-speed burr and then a 7-mm machined lordotic allograft was malleted into place.  There was good bony apposition, both proximally and distally.  Next, a 44-mm Blackstone low-profile anterior cervical plate was applied to the anterior cervical spine with six 14 mm screws.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed appropriate positioning of the plate and the graft.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with normal saline and bacitracin.  There was no active bleeding upon closure of the wound.  A small drain was placed deep.  The platysmal muscle was closed with 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with #4-0 Monocryl.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied.  The patient was monitored throughout the procedure with free-running EMGs and SSEPs and there were no untoward events.

Before the neck instrumentation was performed, the patient's lacerations to her scalp were I&D'ed and closed.  It was noted that the head was significantly contaminated with blood as well as mangled.  It was decided at that time in order to repair the lacerations appropriately, the patient would undergo cutting of her hair.  This was shaved appropriately with shavers.  Once this was done, the scalp lacerations were copiously irrigated with a scrubbing brush, hexedine solution together with peroxide.  Once this was appropriately debrided with regards to the midline incision with the scalp going through the midline of her skull as well as the incision on the left aspect of her scalp, the wounds were significantly irrigated with normal saline.  No significant debris was appreciated.  Once this was done, staples were used to oppose the dermal edges together.  The patient was subsequently dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4x4s, and tape.

Sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct per OR staff.,HISTORY:,  This is a 57-year-old female who was found to have a large left adrenal mass, approximately 5.5 cm in size.  She had undergone workup previously with my associate, Dr. X as well as by Endocrinology, and showed this to be a nonfunctioning mass.  Due to the size, the patient was advised to undergo an adrenalectomy and she chose the laparoscopic approach due to her multiple pulmonary comorbidities.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Showed multiple intraabdominal adhesions in the anterior abdominal wall.  The spleen and liver were unremarkable.  The gallbladder was surgically absent.,There was large amount of omentum and bowel in the pelvis, therefore the gynecological organs were not visualized.  There was no evidence of peritoneal studding or masses.  The stomach was well decompressed as well as the bladder.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, she was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia.  She was placed on a bean bag and secured to the table.  The table was rotated to the right to allow gravity to aid in our retraction of the bowel.,Prep was performed.  Sterile drapes were applied.  Using the Hassan technique, we placed a primary laparoscopy port approximately 3 cm lateral to the umbilicus on the left.  Laparoscopy was performed with ___________.  At this point, we had a second trocar, which was 10 mm to 11 mm port.  Using the non-cutting trocar in the anterior axillary line and using Harmonic scalpel, we did massive lysis of adhesions from the anterior abdominal wall from the length of the prior abdominal incision, the entire length of the abdominal incision from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus.  The adhesions were taken down off the entire anterior abdominal wall.,At this point, secondary and tertiary ports were placed.  We had one near the midline in the subcostal region and to the left midline and one at the midclavicular line, which were also 10 and 11 ports using a non-cutting blade.,At this point, using the Harmonic scalpel, we opened the white line of Toldt on the left and reflected the colon medially, off the anterior aspect of the Gerota's fascia.  Blunt and sharp dissection was used to isolate the upper pole of the kidney, taking down some adhesions from the spleen.  The colon was further mobilized medially again using gravity to aid in our retraction.  After isolating the upper pole of the kidney using blunt and sharp dissection as well as the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to dissect the plane between the upper pole of the kidney and lower aspect of the adrenal gland.  We were able to isolate the adrenal vein, dumping into the renal vein, this was doubly clipped and transected.  There was also noted to be vascular structure of the upper pole, which was also doubly clipped and transected.  Using the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to continue free the remainder of the adrenal glands from its attachments medially, posteriorly, cephalad, and laterally.,At this point, using the EndoCatch bag, we removed the adrenal gland through the primary port in the periumbilical region and sent the flap for analysis.  Repeat laparoscopy showed no additional findings.  The bowel was unremarkable, no evidence of bowel injury, no evidence of any bleeding from the operative site.,The operative site was irrigated copiously with saline and reinspected and again there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdominal cavity was desufflated and was reinspected.  There was no evidence of bleeding.,At this point, the camera was switched to one of the subcostal ports and the primary port in the periumbilical region was closed under direct vision using #0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, each of the other ports were removed and then with palpation of each of these ports, this indicated that the non-cutting ports did close and there was no evidence of fascial defects.,At this point, the procedure was terminated.  The abdominal cavity was desufflated as stated.  The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition.  Postoperative orders were written.  The procedure was discussed with the patient's family at length.nan"
2,"CONSULT FOR PROSTATE CANCER,The patient returned for consultation for his newly diagnosed prostate cancer.  The options including radical prostatectomy with or without nerve sparing were discussed with him with the risks of bleeding, infection, rectal injury, impotence, and incontinence.  These were discussed at length.  Alternative therapies including radiation therapy; either radioactive seed placement, conformal radiation therapy, or the HDR radiation treatments were discussed with the risks of bladder, bowel, and rectal injury and possible impotence were discussed also.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  Hormonal therapy is usually added to the radiation therapy options and this has the risk of osteoporosis, gynecomastia, hot flashes and impotency.  Potency may not recover after the hormone therapy has been completed.  Cryosurgery was discussed with the risks of urinary retention, stricture formation, incontinence and impotency.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  He would need to have a suprapubic catheter for about two weeks and may need to learn self-intermittent catheterization if he cannot void adequately.  Prostate surgery to relieve obstruction and retention after radioactive seeds or cryosurgery has a higher risk of urinary incontinence.  Observation therapy was discussed with him in addition.  I answered all questions that were put to me and I think he understands the options that are available.  I spoke with the patient for over 60 minutes concerning these options.consult - history and phy., prostate cancer, cryosurgery, hdr radiation, prostate surgery, bladder, bleeding, bowel, consultation, impotence, incontinence, infection, prostatectomy, radiation therapy, radical, rectal, rectal fistula, rectal injury, prostate cancer consult, cancer, radiation, prostateNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

2,"XYZ, M.D. ,Suite 123, ABC Avenue ,City, STATE 12345 ,RE:  XXXX, XXXX ,MR#:  0000000,Dear Dr. XYZ: ,XXXX was seen in followup in the Pediatric Urology Clinic.  I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic.  He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ,When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side.  His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration.  They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially.  I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels.  I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation.  If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. ,Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. ,Sincerely yours,letters, differential function, diuretic renal scan, abdominal pain, renal scan, pediatric urology, "
3,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.,ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.,OPERATIVE TIME:  Three hours.,ANESTHESIA TIME:  Four hours.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After thorough preoperative evaluation, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position and after placement of upper extremity IV access and radial A-line, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  A Foley catheter was placed and a right internal jugular central line was placed.  The chest, abdomen, both groin, and perineum were prepped widely with Betadine and draped as a sterile field with an Ioban drape.  A long midline incision from xiphoid to pubis was created with a scalpel and the abdomen was carefully entered.  A sterile Omni-Tract was introduced into the field to retract the abdominal wall and gentle exploration of the abdomen was performed.  With the exception of the vascular findings to be described, there were no apparent intra-abdominal abnormalities.,The transverse colon retracted superiorly.  The small bowel was wrapped in moist green towel and retracted in the right upper quadrant.  The posterior peritoneum overlying the aneurysm was scribed mobilizing the ligament of Treitz thoroughly ligating and dividing the inferior mesenteric vein.  Dissection continued superiorly to identify the left renal vein and the right and left inferior renal arteries.  The mid left renal artery was likewise identified.  The perirenal aorta was prepared for clamp superior to the inferior left renal artery.  During this portion of the dissection, the patient was given multiple small doses of intravenous mannitol to establish an osmotic diuresis.  The distal dissection was then completed exposing each common iliac artery.  The arteries were suitable for control.,The patient was then given 8000 units of intravenous sodium heparin and systemic anticoagulation verified by activated clotting time.  The aneurysm was repaired.,First, the common carotid arteries were controlled with atraumatic clamps.  The inferior left renal artery was controlled with a microvascular clamp and a straight aortic clamp was used to control the aorta superior to this renal artery.  The aneurysm was opened on the right anterior lateral aspect and an endarterectomy of the aneurysm sac was performed.  There was a high-grade stenosis at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and an eversion endarterectomy was performed at this site.  The vessel was controlled with a microvascular clamp.  Two pairs of lumbar arteries were oversewn with 2-0 silk.  A 14 mm Hemashield tube graft was selected and sewn end-to-end fashion to the proximal aorta using a semi continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  At the completion of anastomosis three patch stitches of 3-0 Prolene were required for hemostasis.  The graft was cut to appropriate length and sewn end-to-end at the iliac bifurcation using semi-continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  Prior to completion of this anastomosis, the graft was flushed of air and debris and blood flow was reestablished slowly to the distal native circulation first to the pelvis with external compression on the femoral vessels and finally to the distal native circulation.  The distal anastomosis was competent without leak.,The patient was then given 70 mg of intravenous protamine and final hemostasis obtained using electrocoagulation.  The back bleeding from the inferior mesenteric artery was assessed and was pulsatile and vigorous.  The colon was normal in appearance and this vessel was oversewn using 2-0 silk.  The aneurysm sac was then closed about the grafts snuggly using 3-0 PDS in a vest-over-pants fashion.  The posterior peritoneum was reapproximated using running 3-0 PDS.  The entire large and small bowel were inspected and these structures were well perfused with a strong pulse within the SMA normal appearance of the entire viscera.  The NG tube was positioned in the fundus of the stomach and the viscera returned to their anatomic location.  The midline fascia was then reapproximated using running #1 PDS suture.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with bacitracin and kanamycin solution.  The skin edges coapted using surgical staples.,At the conclusion of the case, sponge and needle counts were correct and a sterile occlusive compressive dressing was applied.gastroenterology, inferior left renal artery, semi continuous prolene suture, juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, inferior mesenteric artery, continuous prolene suture, abdominal aortic aneurysm, hemashield tube, inferior mesenteric, renal artery, aortic aneurysm, aneurysm, iliac, endarterectomy, viscera, hemashield, abdomen, prolene, arteries, juxtarenal, graft, aortic, endotracheal, renal, artery, "

She may also have some GI dysmotility including gastroparesis.,6.  Report of dysphagia to solids over the past several years with a history of a bone spur in her cervical spine.  If this bone spur is pressing anteriorly, it could certainly cause recurrent symptoms of dysphagia.  Differential also includes peptic stricture or Schatzki's ring, and even remotely, the possibility of an esophageal malignancy.,7.  A history of infectious hepatitis in the past with some recent mild elevations in AST and ALT levels without clear etiology.  She may have some reaction to her multiple medications including her statin drugs, which can cause mild elevations in transaminases.  She may have some underlying fatty liver disease and differential could include some form of viral hepatitis such as hepatitis B or even C.,PLAN:,1.  We have asked her to follow up with her primary care physician with regard to this recent elevation in her transaminases.  She will likely have the lab tests repeated in the future, and if they remain persistently elevated, we will be happy to see her in the future for further evaluation if her primary care physician would like.,2.

No definite pneumatosis is appreciated.  No free air is apparent at this time.  Inflammatory changes around this loop of bowel.  Mild distention of adjacent small bowel loops measuring up to 3.5 cm is evident.  No complete obstruction is suspected, as there is contrast material within the colon.  Postsurgical changes compatible with the partial colectomy are noted.  Postsurgical changes of the anterior abdominal wall are seen.  Mild thickening of the urinary bladder wall is seen.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Marked thickening of a segment of distal small bowel is seen with free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.  An inflammatory process such as infection or ischemia must be considered.  Close interval followup is necessary.,2.  Thickening of the urinary bladder wall is nonspecific and may be due to under distention.

Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the chest was prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  A #18-gauge spinal needle was used to aspirate blood from the subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, Seldinger technique was used to thread a J wire.  The distal tip of the J wire was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to make an incision in the skin.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the pectoralis muscle.  A pocket was created.  A dual-port Port-A-Cath was lowered into the pocket and secured with #2-0 Prolene.  Both ports were flushed.  The distal tip was pulled through to the wire exit site with a Kelly clamp.  It was cut to the appropriate length.  Next a dilator and sheath were threaded over the J wire.  The J wire and dilator were removed, and the distal tip of the dual-port Port-A-Cath was threaded over the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  Both ports of the dual-port Port-A-Cath were flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The distal tip was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  The wire access site was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.  The port pocket was closed in 2 layers with 2-0 Vicryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.

A wire lid speculum was carefully placed to provide exposure. A two-armed 7 mm scleral laceration was seen in the supranasal quadrant. The laceration involved the sclera and the limbus in this area. There was a small amount of iris tissue prolapsed in the wound. The Westcott scissors and 0.12 forceps were used to carefully dissect the conjunctiva away from the wound to provide exposure. A cyclodialysis spatula was used to carefully reposit the prolapsed iris tissue back into the anterior chamber. The anterior chamber remained formed and the iris tissue easily resumed its normal position. The pupil appeared round. An 8-0 nylon suture was used to close the scleral portion of the laceration. Three sutures were placed using the 8-0 nylon suture. Then 9-0 nylon suture was used to close the limbal portion of the wound. After the wound appeared closed, a Superblade was used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 o'clock. BSS was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The wound was checked and found to be watertight. No leaks were observed. An 8-0 Vicryl suture was used to reposition the conjunctiva and close the wound. Three 8-0 Vicryl sutures were placed in the conjunctiva. All scleral sutures were completely covered. The anterior chamber remained formed and the pupil remained round and appeared so at the end of the case. Subconjunctival injections of Ancef and dexamethasone were given at the end of the case as well as Tobradex ointment. The lid speculum was carefully removed. The drapes were carefully removed. Sterile saline was used to clean around the XXX eye as well as the rest of the face. The area was carefully dried and an eye patch and shield were taped over the XXX eye. The patient was awakened from general anesthesia without difficulty. (S)he was taken to the recovery area in good condition.

3,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  One-month followup.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is an 88-year-old Caucasian female.  She comes here today with a friend.  The patient has no complaints.  She states she has been feeling well.  Her knees are not hurting her at all anymore and she is not needing Bextra any longer.  I think the last steroid injection that she had with Dr. XYZ really did help.  The patient denies any shortness of breath or cough.  Has no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  No diarrhea or constipation.  She states her appetite is good.  She clears her plate at noon.  She has had no fevers, chills, or sweats.  The friend with her states she is doing very well.  Seems to eat excellently at noontime, despite this, the patient continues to lose weight.  When I asked her what she eats for breakfast and for supper, she states she really does not eat anything.  Her only meal that she eats at the nursing home is the noon meal and then I just do not think she is eating much the rest of the time.  She states she is really not hungry the rest of the time except at lunchtime.  She denies any fevers, chills, or sweats.  We did do some lab work at the last office visit and CBC was essentially normal.  Comprehensive metabolic was essentially normal as was of the BUN of 32 and creatinine of 1.3.  This is fairly stable for her.  Liver enzymes were normal.  TSH was normal.  Free albumin was normal at 23.  She is on different antidepressants and that may be causing some difficulties with unintentional weight loss.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Currently are Aricept 10 mg a day, Prevacid 30 mg a day, Lexapro 10 mg a day, Norvasc 2.5 mg a day, Milk of Magnesia 30 cc daily, and Amanda 10 mg b.i.d.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Reviewed from 05/10/2004 and unchanged other than the addition of paranoia, which is much improved on her current medications.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is widow.  She is a nonsmoker, nondrinker.  She lives at Kansas Christian Home independently, but actually does get a lot of help with medications, having a driver to bring her here, and going to the noon meal.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  As above in HPI.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,General:  This is a well-developed, pleasant Caucasian female, who appears thinner especially in her face.

I think this is more a problem of just not getting in any calories though does not appear to be a medical problem go on, although her dementia may make it difficult for her to remember to eat, and with her antidepressant medication she is on, she just may not have much of an appetite to eat unless food is prepared for her.,2.  Depression, doing well.,3.  Paranoia, doing well.,4.  Dementia, stable.,5.  Osteoarthritis of the knees, pain is much improved.,PLAN:,1.  Continue on current medications.,2.  I did call and talk with doctor at hospital.  We discussed different options.  We have decided to have the patient eat the evening meal at the nursing home also and have her take a supplement drink such as Ensure at breakfast time.  Connie will weigh the patient once a week and I will go ahead and see the patient in one month.  We can see how she is doing at that time.  If she continues to lose weight despite eating better, then I think we will need to do further evaluation.nan"

2,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 56-year-old female who comes in for a dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and weight reduction.  The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today’s weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient’s basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.consult - history and phy., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, weight reduction, dietary recommendations, healthier eating, meal plan, dietary consultation, low fat, physical activity, weight, gastroesophageal, dietary, calories, food"
3,"REASON FOR CATHETERIZATION:,  ST-elevation myocardial infarction.,PROCEDURES UNDERTAKEN,1.  Left coronary system cineangiography.,2.  Right coronary system cineangiography.,3.  Left ventriculogram.,4.  PCI to the left circumflex with a 3.5 x 12 and a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stents postdilated with a 3.75-mm noncompliant balloon x2.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks and benefits were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the cardiac cath suite.  Right groin was prepped in usual sterile fashion.  Right common femoral artery was cannulated with the modified Seldinger technique.  A 6-French sheath was introduced.  Next, Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary artery and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, an EBU 3.5 guide was used to engage the left coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in several views and it was noted to have a 99% proximal left circumflex stenosis.  Angiomax bolus and drip were started after checking an ACT, which was 180, and an Universal wire was advanced through the left circumflex beyond the lesion.  Next, a 3.0 x 12 mm balloon was used to pre-dilate the lesion.  Next a 3.5 x 12 mm Vision bare-metal stent was advanced to the area of stenosis and deployed at 12 atmospheres.  There was noted to be a plaque shift proximally at the edge of the stent.  Therefore, a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stent was advanced to cover the proximal margin of the first stent and deployed at 12 atmospheres.  Next, a 3.75 x 13 mm noncompliant balloon was advanced into the margin of the stent and two inflations at 20 atmospheres were done for 20 seconds.  Final images showed excellent results with initial 99% stenosis reduced to 0%.  The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the mid to distal in the OM branch.  At this point, wire was removed.  Final images confirmed initial stent results, no evidence of dissection, perforation, or complications.,Next, an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity.  LV pressure was measured.  LV gram was done in both the LAO and RAO projections and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded.  Finally, all guides were removed.  Right femoral artery access site was imaged and Angio-Seal deployed to attain excellent hemostasis.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications.,DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS,1.  Left main:  Left main is a large-caliber vessel bifurcating in LAD and left circumflex with no significant disease.,2.  The LAD:  LAD is a large-caliber vessel, wraps around the apex, gives off multiple septal perforators, three small-to-medium caliber diagonal branches without any significant disease.,3.  Left circumflex:  Left circumflex is a large-caliber vessel, gives off a large distal PDA branch, has a 99% proximal lesion, 50% mid vessel lesion, and a 50% lesion in the OM, which is a distal branch.,4.  Right coronary artery:  Right coronary artery is a moderate-caliber vessel, dominant, bifurcates into PDA and PLV branches, has only mild disease.  Otherwise, no significant stenosis noted.,5.  LV:  The LVEF 50%.  Inferolateral wall hypokinesis.  No significant mitral regurgitation.  No gradient across the aortic valve on pullback.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , ST-elevation myocardial infarction with a 99% stenosis of the proximal portion of the left circumflex treated with a 3.5 x 12 mm Vision bare-metal stent and a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stent.  Excellent results, 0% residual stenosis.  The patient continues to have some residual 50% stenosis in the left circumflex system, some mild disease throughout the other vessels.  Therefore, we will aggressively treat this patient medically with close followup as an outpatient.cardiovascular / pulmonary, ventriculogram, circumflex, bare-metal stents, myocardial infarction, st-elevation, coronary system cineangiography, infarction, stents, cineangiography, stenosis,"

Modified Le Fort I osteotomy.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE:, The patient has undergone previous surgical treatment and had a diagnosis of basal cell nevus syndrome.  Currently our plan is to remove the impacted third molar teeth, to remove a cystic lesion left posterior mandible, to remove 4 second bicuspid teeth as requested by her orthodontist, and to weaken and her maxilla to allow expansion by a modified Le Fort osteotomy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the operating table in supine position.  Following treatment under adequate general anesthesia via the orotracheal route, the patient was prepped and draped in a manner consistent with intraoral surgical procedures.  The oral cavity was suctioned, was drained of fluid and a throat pack was placed.  General anesthesia nursing service was notified and which was removed at the end of the procedure.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine concentration in 1:100,000 was injected into the labial vestibule of the maxilla bilaterally as well as the lateral areas associated with the extractions sites in lower jaw and the left posterior mandible for a total of 11 mL.  A Bovie electrocautery was utilized to make a vestibular incision, beginning in the second molar region of the maxilla superior to the mucogingival junction extending to the area of the cuspid teeth.  Subperiosteal dissection revealed lateral aspect of the maxilla immediately posterior to the second molar tooth where the third molar tooth was identified and was bony crypt.  Following use of Cerebromaxillary osteotome, elevated, and underwent complete removal of the dental follicle.  Secondly, tooth number 4 was removed.  Tooth number 13 was removed, and the opposite third molar tooth was removed through an identical incision on the opposite side.  Surgeon then utilized a #15 saw to make a horizontal osteotomy through the lateral aspect of the maxilla from the target plates, anteriorly to the area of the buttress region cross the anterior maxilla to a point adjacent to the piriform rim, 5 mm superior to the nasal floor, bilaterally Cerebromaxillary osteotome utilized to separate the maxilla from the target placed posteriorly and a 5 mm Tessier osteotome through a vertical incision anteriorly between roots of teeth numbers 8 and 9.  This resulted in the alternate mobilization of the two halves of the maxilla, or to allow expansion.  These wounds were all irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline and with antibiotic containing solution, closed with 3-0 chromic suture in running fashion for watertight closure.  Attention was directed to the mandible where the left posterior mandible was approached through a lateral vestibular incision overlying the external oblique ridge and brought anteriorly in an old scar.  The surgeons utilized cautery osteotome to identify a cystic lesion associated with the left posterior mandible, which was approximately 1 cm in width and 2.5 to 3 cm in vertical dimension immediately adjacent to the neurovascular bundle.  This wound was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline and concentrated solution of clindamycin.  Closed primarily with a 3-0 Vicryl suture in running fashion for a watertight closure.  Teeth number 20 and 29 where removed and 3-0 chromic suture placed.  This concluded the procedure.  All cottonoids and other sponges, throat pack were removed.  No complications were encountered.  The aforementioned cystic lesion was sent with specimen no drains were placed.  The blood loss from this procedure was approximately 100 mL.,The patient was returned over the care of the anesthesia where she was extubated in the operating room, taken from the operating room to the recovery room with stable vital signs and spontaneous respirations.surgery, nevus syndrome, basal cell, mandible, teeth, hyperplasia, cystic lesion, osteotomy, le fort, le fort osteotomy, orotracheal route, bony crypt, watertight, removal of cystic lesion, le fort i osteotomy, aspect of the maxilla, modified le fort, molar tooth, posterior mandible, maxillary, molar, tooth,"
4,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Torn rotator cuff, right shoulder.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Torn rotator cuff, right shoulder.,2.  Subacromial spur with impingement syndrome, right shoulder.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Diagnostic arthroscopy with subacromial decompression.,2.  Open repair of rotator cuff using three Panalok suture anchors.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Approximately 200 cc.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , There was noted to be a full thickness tear to the supraspinatus tendon at the insertion of the greater tuberosity.  There is moderate amount of synovitis noted throughout the glenohumeral joint.  There is a small subacromial spur noted on the very anterolateral border of the acromion.,HISTORY: , This is a 62-year-old female who previously underwent a repair of rotator cuff.  She continued to have pain within the shoulder.  She had a repeat MRI performed, which confirmed the clinical diagnosis of re-tear of the rotator cuff.  She wished to proceed with a repair.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the above treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 08/21/03, she was taken to the Operative Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  She was placed in the modified beachchair position.  Her upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in the posterior aspect of the glenohumeral joint.  A camera was placed in the joint and was insufflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained and the above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated anteriorly.  Through this a probe was placed and the intraarticular structures were palpated and found to be intact.  A tear of the inner surface of the rotator cuff was identified.  The camera was then taken to the subacromial space.  A straight lateral portal was also used and a shaver was placed into the subacromial space.  Further debridement of the anterolateral border of the acromion was performed to remove evidence of the subacromial spur, which had reformed.  The edges of the rotator cuff were then debrided.  The camera was then removed and the shoulder was suction and dried.  A lateral incision was made over the anterolateral border of the acromion.  Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The deltoid musculature was then incised and aligned with its fibers exposing the rotator cuff tear and the edges were further debrided using a rongeur.  A trough was then made in the greater tuberosity using the rongeur.  Two Panalok anchors were then placed within the trough and weaved through the suture and third Panalok anchor was placed medial to the trough and weaved through the rotator cuff.  The ends of the suture were tied down from the fixating the rotator cuff within the trough.  The rotator cuff was then further oversewed using the Panalok suture.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and it was then suction dried.  The deltoid muscle was reapproximated using #1 Vicryl.  A continuous infusion pump catheter was placed into the subacromial space to help with postoperative pain control.  The subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  Sterile dressing was applied to the upper extremity.  She was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer.  She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient was guarded.  She will begin pendulum exercises postoperative day #3.  She will follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for reevaluation.  Physical therapy initiated approximately six weeks postoperatively.orthopedic, subacromial decompression, panalok suture, repair of rotator cuff, torn rotator cuff, diagnostic arthroscopy, subacromial space, subacromial spur, arthroscopy, panalok, shoulder, subacromial,"
2,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.,According to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  He started to shuffle.  He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006.  At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  He has not fallen in the last month.  He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  His family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.,In regard to the bladder, he states, ""I wet the bed.""  In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  This was treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence.  The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.,He has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.,In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  His wife took over his medications about two years ago.  She stopped his driving about three years ago.  She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  Apparently, he did not object.  At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  He needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  He is a retired office machine repairman.  He is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.,He has not had PT or OT and has not been treated with medications for Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.

3,"OPERATION,1.  Ivor-Lewis esophagogastrectomy.,2.  Feeding jejunostomy.,3.  Placement of two right-sided #28-French chest tubes.,4.  Right thoracotomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  In addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  The patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  His abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  After applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  Dissection was carried down through the linea using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened.  Next, a Balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  Next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  In an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  We incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  The omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  We did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  Next, we turned our attention to performing a Kocher maneuver.  This was done and the stomach was freed up.  We took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  At this point the stomach was freely mobile.  We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.  We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site.  We tied down in place.  We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel.  Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  After doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  This was done with #1 Prolene.  We put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.,Next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  The right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  We then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We placed standard chest retractors.  Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  We used an automatic pursestring and applied.  We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors.  We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler.  After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery.  We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler.  This was then secured appropriately.  We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  We then fired the stapler.  We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The lung was brought up.  We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the ICU in good condition.gastroenterology, ivor-lewis, esophagogastrectomy, jejunostomy, thoracotomy, dual-lumen tube, chest tubes, bovie electrocautery, chest, endotracheal, electrocautery, abdomen, gastric, esophagus, tubes, vicryl, stomach, "

Patient reports that he would like to try Cialis to see if it will improve his erectile performance.  Patient states that he did a quiz on-line at the Cialis web site and did not score in the normal range, so he thought he should come in.  Patient states that perhaps his desire has been slightly decreased, but that has not been the primary problem.  In discussing with me directly, patient primarily expresses that he would like to have his erections last longer.  However, looking at the quiz as he filled it out, he reported that much less than half the time was he able to get erections during sexual activity and only about half of the time he was able to maintain his erection after penetration.

This included the neck accordingly.,Two platysmal sling application and operating headlight were utilized.  Hemostasis was controlled with the pinpoint cautery along with suction Bovie cautery.,The first procedure was performed was that of a quadrilateral blepharoplasty.  Markers were applied to both upper lids in symmetrical fashion.  The skin was excised from the right upper lid first followed by appropriate muscle resection.  Minimal fat removed from the medial upper portion of the eyelid.  Hemostasis was controlled with the quadrilateral tip needle; closure with a running 7-0 nylon suture.  Attention was then turned to the lower lid.  A classic skin muscle flap was created accordingly.  Fat was resected from the middle, medial, and lateral quadrant.  The fat was allowed to open drain the arcus marginalis for appropriate contour.  Hemostasis was controlled with the pinpoint cautery accordingly.  Skin was redraped with a conservative amount resected.  Running closure with 7-0 nylon was accomplished without difficulty.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the left upper and lower lid.,After completion of this portion of the procedure, the lag lid was again placed in the eyes.  Eye mass was likewise clamped.  Attention was turned to her face with plans for cervical facial rhytidectomy portion of the procedure.  The right face was first operated.  It was injected with a 0.25% Marcaine 1:200,000 adrenaline.  A submental incision was created followed by suction lipectomy and very minimal amounts of ***** in 3 mm and 2-mm suction cannula.  She had minimal subcutaneous extra fat as noted.  Attention was then turned to the incision which was in the temporal hairline in curvilinear fashion following the pretragal incision to the postauricular sulcus and into and along the post-occipital hairline.  The flap was elevated without difficulty with various facelift scissors.  Hemostasis was controlled again with a pinpoint cautery as well as suction Bovie cautery.,The exact same elevation of skin flap was accomplished on the left face followed by the anterosuperior submental space with approximately 4-cm incision.  Rectus plication in the midline with a running 4-0 Mersilene was followed by some transaction of the platysma above the hairline with coagulation, cutting, and cautery.  The submental incision was closed with a running 7-0 nylon over 5-0 Monocryl.,Attention was then turned to closure of the bilateral facelift incisions after appropriate SMAS plication.  The left side of face was first closed followed by interrupted SMAS plication utilizing 4-0 wide Mersilene.  The skin was draped appropriately and appropriate tissue was resected.  A 7-mm 9-0 French drain was utilized accordingly prior to closure of the skin with interrupted 4-0 Monocryl in the post-occipital region followed by running 5-0 nylon in the postauricular surface.  Preauricular interrupted 5-0 Monocryl was followed by running 7-0 nylon.  The hairline temporal incision was closed with running 5-0 nylon.  The exact same closure was accomplished on the right side of the face with a same size 7-mm French drain.,The patient's dressing consisted of Adaptic Polysporin ointment followed by Kerlix wrap with a 3-inch Ace.,The lips and mouth were sterilely prepped and draped accordingly after application of the head drape dressing as described.  Suction lipectomy was followed in the abdomen with sterile conditions were prepped and draped accordingly.  Approximately 2.5 to 3 cc of autologous fat was injected into the upper lip of the remaining cutaneous line with blunt tip dissector after having washed the fat with saline accordingly.  Tuberculin syringes were utilized on the injection utilizing a larger blunt tip needle for the actual injection procedure.  The incision site was closed with 7-0 nylon.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with Foley catheter in position.,The patient will be admitted for overnight short stay through the cosmetic package procedure.  She will be discharged in the morning.,Estimated blood loss was less than 75 cc.

The patient has been having difficult time with having two to three bouts of tonsillitis this year.  She does average about four bouts of tonsillitis per year for the past several years.  She notes that throat pain and fever with the actual infections.  She is having no difficulty with swallowing.  She does have loud snoring, though there have been no witnessed observed sleep apnea episodes.  She is a mouth breather at nighttime, however.  The patient does feel that she has a cold at today's visit.  She has had tonsil problems again for many years.  She does note a history of intermittent hoarseness as well.  This is particularly prominent with the current cold that she has had.  She had been seen by Dr. Y in Muskegon who had also recommended a tonsillectomy, but she reports she would like to get the surgery done here in the Ludington area as this is much closer to home.  For the two tonsillitis, she is on antibiotics again on an average about four times per year.  They do seem to help with the infections, but they tend to continue to recur.

1,"Sample Address,RE:  Sample Patient,Wife's name:  Sample Name,Dear Sample Doctor:,Mr. Sample Patient was seen on Month DD, YYYY, describing a vasectomy 10 years ago and a failed vasectomy reversal done almost two years ago at the University of Michigan.  He has remained azoospermic postoperatively.  The operative note suggests the presence of some sperm and sperm head on the right side at the time of the vasectomy reversal.,He states that he is interested in sperm harvesting and cryopreservation prior to the next attempted ovulation induction for his wife.  Apparently, several attempts at induction have been tried and due to some anatomic abnormality, they have been unsuccessful.,At the time that he left the office, he was asking for cryopreservation.  At the time of sperm harvesting, I recently received a phone call suggesting that he does not want to do this at all unless his wife's ovulation has been confirmed and it appears then that he may be interested in a fresh specimen harvest.  I look forward to hearing from you regarding the actual plan so that we can arrange our procedure appropriately.  At his initial request, Month DD, YYYY was picked as the date for scheduled harvesting, although this may change if you require fresh specimen.,Thank you very much for the opportunity to have seen him.,Sample Doctor, M.D.urology, letter, urology letter, azoospermic, cryopreservation, specimen harvest, sperm harvesting, vasectomy, vasectomy reversal, fresh specimen, reversal, sperm,"
1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee.,PROCEDURE  PERFORMED:,  Left unicompartmental knee replacement.,COMPONENTS USED:,  Biomet size medium femoral component size B tibial tray and a 3 mm polyethylene component.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 59 minutes.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , A 55-year-old female who had previously undergone a Biomet Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement on the right side.  She has done quite well with this.  She now has had worsening left knee pain predominantly on the inside of her knee and has consented for unicompartmental knee replacement on the left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  After appropriate anesthesia, the left lower extremity was identified with a time out procedure.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  Left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion after applying a thigh tourniquet.  The tourniquet was insufflated after elevation of the limb, and a standard medial parapatellar incision was used.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down the retinaculum, was opened sharply to expose the joint, meniscus that was visible along the tibia was removed.  The anterior fat pad was removed.  The knee was then examined.  The ACL was found to be intact.  The lateral compartment had very minimal arthritis.  There were some osteoarthritic changes of the patellofemoral joint, but these were felt to be mild.  Following this, the tibial external alignment guide was placed and pinned into place in the appropriate place.  Tibial bone cut was made and checked with a feeler gauge and felt to be an adequate resection.  Following this resection, the femoral intramedullary guide was placed without difficulty.  The femoral cutting guide was then placed and referenced off of this femoral intramedullary guide.  Once in the appropriate position, it was pinned and drilled.  This was removed, and the posterior cutting block was inserted.  It was impacted into place.  Posterior bone cut was made for the medium femoral component.  Next, a zero spigot was used and the distal femur was reamed.  Following this, the check of the extension and flexion gaps revealed that an additional 1 mm needed to be reamed, so 1 spigot was used and this was reamed as well.  Next, trial components were placed into the knee and the knee was taken through range of motion and felt to come out to full extension with a 3 mm poly with a good fit.  Next, the tibia was prepared.  The tibial tray was pinned into place, and the cuts for the keel of the tibia were made.  These were removed with a small osteotome from the set.  Following this, a trial tibial with the keel was placed and it did fit nicely.  After this, all trial components were removed.  The knee was copiously irrigated.  Cement was begun mixing.  Drill holes were used along the femur for cement interdigitation.  The wound was cleaned and dried.  Cement was placed on the tibia.  Tibial tray was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  Tibia was placed in the femur.  Femoral component was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  It was held with a 4 mm trial insert and approximately 30 degrees of knee flexion until the cement had hardened.  Following this, it was again trialed with a meniscal bearing implant and it was felt that 3 mm would be the appropriate size.  A 3 mm polyethylene was chosen and inserted in the knee without difficulty, taken through range of motion and found to come out to full extension with no impingement and full flexion.  The intramedullary rod removed from the femur.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The retinaculum was closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 Monocryl was used for the subcutaneous tissue and staples used for the skin.  A sterile dressing was placed.  Tourniquet was then desufflated.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  Dr. Jinnah was present for the surgery.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will be weightbearing as tolerated in the left lower extremity and will be maintained on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.

4,"INDICATION FOR CONSULTATION: , Increasing oxygen requirement.,HISTORY: , Baby boy, XYZ, is a 29-3/7-week gestation infant.  His mother had premature rupture of membranes on 12/20/08.  She then presented to the Labor and Delivery with symptoms of flu.  The baby was then induced and delivered.  The mother had a history of premature babies in the past.  This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%.  He is now on 60% FiO2.,PHYSICAL FINDINGS,GENERAL:  He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.,SKIN:  He was pink.,He was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.,His echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy.  He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension.  A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt.  A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt.  The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.,IMPRESSION: , My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension.  The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen.  If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide.  Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time.  He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.,Thank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care.pediatrics - neonatal, high-frequency ventilator, structural anatomy, foramen ovale, oxygen requirement, hypertension, pulmonary "

The patient was then prepped and draped using standard procedure.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to keep the eye open and the eye rotated downward with a 0.12.  The anterior chamber was entered by making a small superior limbal incision with a crescent blade and then entering the anterior chamber with a keratome.  The chamber was then filled with viscoelastic and a continuous-tear capsulorrhexis performed.  The phacoemulsification was then instilled in the eye and a linear incision made in the lens.  The lens was then cracked with a McPherson forceps, and the remaining lens material removed with the phacoemulsification tip.  The remaining cortex was removed with an I&A.  The capsular bag was then inflated with viscoelastic and the wound extended slightly with the keratome.  The folding posterior chamber lens was then inserted in the capsular bag and rotated into position.  The remaining viscoelastic was removed from the eye with the I&A.  The wound was checked for watertightness and found to be watertight.  Tobramycin drops were instilled in the eye and a shield placed over it.

3,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Empyema of the chest, left.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Empyema of the chest, left.,PROCEDURE: , Left thoracotomy with total pulmonary decortication and parietal pleurectomy.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room, where he underwent a general endotracheal anesthetic using a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  A time-out process had been followed and preoperative antibiotics were given.,The patient was positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed.  It included the previous incision.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  Actually, there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke.  Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura.  We aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity.  The sample was taken for culture and sensitivity.,Then, at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm.  Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung.  Further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent.,Then, we were left with the trapped lung.  It was trapped by thickened visceral pleura.  This was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively.  Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily.  There was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I was not able to fill.  This area, of course, was very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that.  Two large chest tubes were placed.  The cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline.  Then, the thoracotomy was closed in layers using heavy stitches of Vicryl as pericostal sutures and then several figure-of-eight interrupted sutures to the muscle layers and a combination of nylon stitches and staples to the skin.,The chest tubes were affixed to the skin with heavy sutures of silk.  Dressings were applied and the patient was put back in the supine position and after a few minutes of observation and evaluation, he was able to be extubated in the operating room.,Estimated blood loss was about 500 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well and was sent to the ICU in a satisfactory condition.cardiovascular / pulmonary, total pulmonary decortication, pulmonary decortication, parietal pleurectomy, endotracheal tube, chest retractor, chest tubes, parietal pleura, pleurectomy, empyema, endotracheal, thoracotomy, pleura, chest "

Extensive anterior abdominal wall/uterine/bladder adhesiolysis.,ANESTHESIA:,  Spinal/epidural with good effect.,FINDINGS:  ,Delivered vigorous male infant from cephalic presentation.  Apgars 9/9.  Birth weight 6 pounds 14 ounces.  Infant suctioned with a bulb upon delivery of the head and body.  Cord clamped and cut and infant passed to pediatric team present.  Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord.  Extensive anterior abdominal wall adhesions with the anterior abdominal wall completely adhered to the anterior uterus throughout its entire length of the incision.  In addition, the bladder was involved in adhesion mass complex.  A window was developed surgically at the apical aspect of the incision enabling finger to pass to get behind the dense anterior abdominal wall adhesions.  These adhesions were surgically transected using Bovie cautery technique freeing up the anterior uterine attachment from the anterior abdominal wall.  Upon initial entry through the fibrous layer of the anterior abdominal wall _______ into the serosal and slightly muscular part of the anterior uterus due to the dense adhesion attachment that had occurred from previous surgeries.  Bilateral tubal ligation performed without difficulty via Parkland technique.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,URINE OUTPUT:  ,Per anesthesia records.  Urine cleared postoperatively.,IV FLUIDS:  ,Per anesthesia records.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition with stable vital signs.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was placed in a supine position after spinal/epidural anesthesia.  She was prepped and draped in the usual manner for repeat cesarean section.  A sharp knife was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision at the site of the previous scar.  This was carried through the subcutaneous tissue into the dense fibromuscular and fascial layer with a sharp knife.  This incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  Dense fibromuscular layer was encountered from the patient's previous surgeries.  Upon entry, incision was entered into the serosal and partial muscular layer of the anterior uterus and there was no free area to enter into the peritoneal cavity due to dense fibromuscular adhesions of the entire uterus to the anterior abdominal wall at the length of the incision.  Fascia was previously separated superiorly and inferiorly from the muscular layer.  A surgical window was created at the apical aspect of the incision in the direction of the uterine fundus.  Finger was able to be passed and placed behind the dense adhesions between the uterus through anterior abdominal wall.  This adhesion complex was transacted via Bovie cautery its entire length circumferentially freeing the uterus from its attachment to anterior abdominal wall.  Inferiorly, difficulty was encountered with adhesion separation involving the bladder additionally to the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall.  These adhesions likewise were surgically transacted via sharp, blunt, and electrocautery dissection.  This was successfully done without anterior entry into the bladder.  Smooth pickups and Metzenbaum scissors were then used to do sharp dissection to separated the bladder from its attachment to the lower uterine segment enabling the vesicouterine peritoneal reflection for incision of the uterus.  The uterus was then incised using a sharp knife and low transverse incision.  This was extended with bandage scissors.  The infant was delivered easily from a cephalic presentation.  Bulb suction was done following delivery of the head and body.  The cord clamped and cut and the infant passed to pediatric team present.  Cord segment and cord blood was obtained.  Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord.  Vigorous male infant, Apgars 9/9, weight 6 pounds 14 ounces.  Complete placenta with three vessels retrieved.  Uterus was exteriorized from the abdominal cavity.  Wet lap applied to the fundus and dry lap used to remove the remaining membranous tissue from the lining.  Pennington clamps placed at the uterine incision angles and the inferior incision lip.  A #1 chromic suture closed the uterus in running continuous interlocking closure.  Good hemostasis upon completion of the closure.  Laparotomy pads placed in the posterior cul-de-sac to remove any blood or clots.  The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity, after using #1 chromic suture to close the anterior uterine incision, that was partial thickness through the serosal end of the muscular layer at midline adhesion.  This was closed with chromic suture in a running continuous interlocking closure with good hemostasis.  Attention was then focused on the bilateral tubal ligation.  Babcock clamp placed in the mid fallopian tube and elevated.  Cautery was used to make a window in the avascular segment of the mesosalpinx.  Proximal and distal #1 chromic suture ligation with mid fallopian tube transection performed.  The ligated proximal and distal stumps were then cauterized with Bovie cautery.  This tubal ligation procedure was done in a bilateral fashion.  Upon completion of tubal ligation, uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  Left and right gutters examined and found to be clean and dry.  Evaluation of the low uterine segment incision revealed continued hemostasis.  Oozing was encountered in the inferior bladder of dissection and 2-0 chromic suture in running continuous fashion, partial thickness of the bladder to control the oozing at this site was successfully done.  Interceed was then placed on the low uterine incision and the low anterior uterine aspect.  The midline rectus including peritoneum was re-approximated with simple interrupted chromic sutures.  Irrigation of the muscular layer with good hemostasis noted.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl in a running continuous closure.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated, additional hemostasis with Bovie cautery.

Insertion of Mahurkar catheter for hemofiltration via the left common femoral vein.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , With the patient in the supine position, he was prepped from shin to knees and draped in a sterile field.  A right common femoral artery vein were then exposed through a longitudinal incision in the right groin and prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass.  A sternotomy incision was then opened and the lesions from the previous operative procedures were lysed and they were very dense and firm, freeing up the right atrium and the ascending aorta and anterior right ventricle.  The patient was heparinized and then a pursestring suture was placed in the right atrium superior and inferior just above the superior and inferior vena cava.  A percutaneous catheter for arterial return was placed using Seldinger technique through exposed right femoral artery and then two 3-mm catheters were inserted with two pursestring sutures in the right atrium just superior to inferior vena cava.  After satisfactory heparinization has been obtained, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and another pursestring suture was placed in the right superior pulmonary vein and a catheter was placed for suction in the left atrium.  After the heart was brought to the operating room and triggered, the patient had the ascending aorta clamped and tapes were placed around superior and inferior vena cava and were secured in place.  A cardiectomy was then performed by starting in the right atrium.  The wires from the pacemaker and defibrillator were transected coming from the superior vena cava and the Swan-Ganz catheter was brought out into the operative field.  Cardiectomy was then performed, first resecting the anterior portion of the right atrium and then transecting the aorta, the pulmonary artery, the septum between the right and left atriums, and then the heart was removed.  The right and left atrium, aorta, and pulmonary artery were prepared for the transplant.  First, we did a side-to-side anastomosis, continued to the left atrium and this was performed using 3-0 Prolene suture and a right atrial anastomosis side-to-side was performed using 3-0 Prolene suture.  The pulmonary artery was then anastomosed using 5-0 Prolene and the aorta was anastomosed with 4-0 Prolene.  The arterial anastomosis in the pulmonary artery and aorta were not completed until the heart was filled with blood.  Air was evacuated and the sutures were tied down.  The clamp on the ascending aorta was removed and the patient was gradually overtime weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient had a postoperative coagulopathy which prolonged the period of time in the operating room after completion and weaning off of the cardiopulmonary bypass.  Blood factors and factor VII were given to try and correct the coagulopathy.  Because of excessive transfusions that were required, a Mahurkar catheter was inserted through the left common femoral vein, first placing a needle into the vein and then guidewire removed, and the needle dilators were then placed and then the Mahurkar catheter was then placed with 2-0 nylon suture.  Hemofiltration was started in the operating room at this time.  After he had satisfactory hemostasis, we decided to do the chest open and cover it with Ioban, which we did, and one chest tube was inserted into the mediastinum through a separate stab wound.  The patient also had an intraaortic balloon for counterpulsation which had been inserted into the left subclavian vein preoperatively.  This was left in place and the pulse generation, the pacemaker was in a right infraclavicular position, which was left in place because of the coagulopathy.  The patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells, 7 platelets, 23 fresh-frozen plasma, 20 cryoprecipitates, and factor VII.  Urine output for the procedure was 520 mL.  The preservation time of the heart is in the anesthesia sheet.  The estimated blood loss was at least 6 L.

She had recently undergone an additional compression fracture of the T8 vertebrae.  She was in extreme pain.  This pain interfered with activities of daily living and was unimproved with conservative treatment modalities.  She is understanding the risks, benefits, and potential complications as well as all treatment alternatives.  The patient provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #2 where she was placed prone on the Jackson spinal table.  She was given sedative.  The thoracodorsal spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Biplanar image intensification was utilized to localize the T8, T7, and T9 vertebrae.  Local anesthetic of 1% Marcaine with epinephrine and lidocaine were 50:50 mixed.,Approximately 7 cc was instilled on the left side.  This was directly over the posterior aspect of the pedicle on the left.  Once this was localized, the right side was localized as well.  Stab incisions were then created over the pedicles of T8 bilaterally.  Jamshidi needles were then placed percutaneously.  Their position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  They were advanced slowly under direct image intensification in biplanar fashion.  Once these were satisfactorily placed, the inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was inserted into the depths of the T7 vertebrae.  The Jamshidi needles were then removed.  A biopsy was then harvested with a biopsy trocar placed into the T8 vertebrae.  This bone was then removed and sent to the lab.  The injection cannulas were then placed over the guidewires and their position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, a second Jamshidi needle was placed at the T7 vertebrae on the left at the entrance of the pedicle.  This was advanced under direct image intensification in a biplanar fashion.  Once this was deemed satisfactory, it was impacted.  The inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was then placed.  An injection cannula was then placed over the guidewire into the body of T7.  In a similar fashion, T9 was dressed on the left side as well.  A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, which was verified in both AP and lateral images.  The cement injection cannula was then placed over this entering the T9 vertebrae body.  Attention was then turned to the kyphoplasty portion of the procedure at the T8 vertebrae.  The balloons were inserted bilaterally.  The balloons were then inflated under direct image intensification and pressurized to approximately 200 mmHg.  These were allowed to expand and reduce the fracture.  Once this was completed, the balloons were deflated and removed.  The inner cannulas of all four entrance holes were removed and approximately 1.5 cc of cement was injected in each of the cannulas.  This was done directly under image intensification.  Once this was completed, additional cement was injected into T9 as there was a larger vertebra.  The cement was allowed to cure.  The cannula was removed and final radiographs were obtained.  The stab incisions were then cleansed with water and antibiotic irrigation.  The wounds were then approximated with #4-0 Nylon in interrupted fashion.  Compression dressings were applied and fixed with tape.  She was aroused and moved to her inpatient bed.  She was moving all four extremities without deficit.

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces.  Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner.  Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided.  The most prominent osteophyte and compression was at C5-C6 followed by C6-C7 and C4-C5 with a complete decompression of the spinal canal allowing the dura to finally bulge into the interspace at all three levels, once the ligaments were proximally removed as well and similarly a sign of a decompressed status.  The nerve roots themselves were inspected with a double ball dissector and found to be equally decompressed.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently irrigated away.  Appropriate size Bengal cages were filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position, filled along with fusion putty, and once these were quite tightly applied and checked, further stability was added by the placement of a Slim-LOC plate of appropriate size with appropriate size screws, and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and inspected, and hemostasis was completely achieved and finally the wound was closed in a routine closure by approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was sterilely dressed, and incorporated a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in a routine fashion.  At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type.neurosurgery, herniated nucleus pulposus, radiculopathy, cervical stenosis, anterior instrumentation, stabilization, slim-loc, neural decompression, anterior cervical discectomy, cord compression, interbody fusion, bengal cages, interbody, compression, anterior, fusion, decompression, discectomy, cervical"

All endometriosis had been identified laparoscopically from a previous surgery.  At the time of the surgery, all the tissue was quite thick and difficult to cut as well around the bladder flap and the uterus itself.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position, at which time general form of anesthesia was administered by the anesthesia department.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  Approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis, a first knife was used to make a low transverse incision.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher.  Both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was then completed consistent with Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the midline and extended in a vertical fashion.  Perineum was entered at the high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  An O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was put in place on either side.  A bladder blade was put in place as well.  Uterus was grasped with a double-tooth tenaculum and large and small colon were packed away cephalically and held in place with free wet lap packs and a superior blade.  The bladder flap was released with Metzenbaum scissors and then dissected away caudally.  EndoGIA were placed down both sides of the uterus in two bites on each side with the staples reinforced with a medium Endoclip.  Two Heaney were placed on either side of the uterus at the level of cardinal ligaments.  These were sharply incised and both pedicles were tied off with 1 Vicryl suture.  Two _____ were placed from either side of the uterus at the level just inferior to the cervix across the superior part of the vaginal vault.  A long sharp knife was used to transect the uterus at the level of Merz forceps and the uterus and cervix were removed intact.  From there, the corners of the vaginal cuff were reinforced with figure-of-eight stitches.  Betadine soaked sponge was placed in the vaginal vault and a continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the edges with a second layer used to reinforce the first.  Bladder flap was created with the use of 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam was placed underneath.  The EndoGIA was used to transect both the fallopian tube and ovaries at the infundibulopelvic ligament and each one was reinforced with medium clips.  The entire area was then re-peritonized and copious amounts of saline were used to irrigate the pelvic cavity.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was placed into the cul-de-sac and the O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was removed as well as all the wet lap pack.  Edges of the peritoneum were grasped in 3 quadrants with hemostat and a continuous locking stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the peritoneum as well as abdominal rectus muscle.  The edges of the fascia were grasped at both corners and a continuous locking stitch of 1 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the fascia with overlapping in the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the tissue and the skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied and Betadine soaked sponge was removed from the vaginal vault and the vaginal vault was wiped clean of any remaining blood.

4,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 69-year-old single Caucasian female with a past medical history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, GERD, and dyslipidemia who presents to the emergency room with the complaint of ""manic"" symptoms due to recent medication adjustments.  The patient had been admitted to St. Luke's Hospital on Month DD, YYYY for altered mental status and at that time, the medical team discontinued Zyprexa and lithium.  In the emergency room, the patient reported elevated mood, pressured speech, irritability, decreased appetite, and impulsivity.  She also added that over the past three days, she felt more confused and reported having blackouts as well as hallucinations about white lines and dots on her arms and face from the medication changes.  She was admitted voluntarily to the inpatient unit and medications were not restarted for her.  On the unit this morning, the patient is loud and nonredirectable, she is singing loudly and speaking in a very pressured manner.  She reports that she would like to speak with Dr. A, the neurologist who saw her at St. Luke's, because she ""trust him.""  The patient is somewhat reluctant to answer questions stating that she has answered enough of people's questions; however, she is talkative and reports that she feels as though she needs a sedative.  The patient reports that she is originally from Brooklyn, New York, and she moved down to Houston about a year ago to be with her daughter.  She also expressed frustration over the fact that her daughter wanted her removed from the apartment she was in initially and had her placed in a nursing home due to inability to care for herself.

2,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 38-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema who comes in because of new onset of headaches.  She comes to clinic by herself.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Dr. X has cared for her since 2002.  She has a Codman-Hakim shunt set at 90 mmH2O.  She last saw us in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.  We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She states that since that time her headaches have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She has not been able to sleep.  She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.  She reports no nausea at this time.  She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well.  She tells me that she has an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.  She reports no other complaints at this time.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  On examination today, this is a pleasant 38-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area without difficulty.  She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 153/86, pulse 63, and respiratory rate 16.,Cranial Nerves:  Intact for extraocular movements.  Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movements are all intact.  I did not know any papilledema on exam bilaterally.,I examined her shut site, which is clean, dry, and intact.  She did have a small 3 mm to 4 mm round scab, which was noted farther down from her shunt reservoir.  It looks like there is a little bit of dry blood there.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient appears to have had worsening headaches since shunt adjustment back after an MRI.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema.,2.  Migraine headaches.,PROCEDURES:,  I programmed her shunt to 90 mmH2O.,PLAN:,  It was noted that the patient began to have an acute onset of headache pain after her shunt adjustment approximately a week and a half ago.  I had programmed her shunt back to 90 mmH2O at that time and confirmed it with an x-ray.  However, the picture of the x-ray was not the most desirable picture.  Thus, I decided to reprogram the shunt back to 90 mmH2O today and have the patient return to Sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90.  In addition, she told me that she is scheduled to see Dr. Y tomorrow, so she should followup with him and also plan on contacting the Wilmer Eye Institute to setup an appointment.  She should followup with the Wilmer Eye Institute as she is complaining of blurry vision and dimming of the lights occasionally.,Total visit time was approximately 60 minutes and about 10 minutes of that time was spent in counseling the patient.consult - history and phy., migraine headaches, pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema, onset of headaches, blurry vision, shunt adjustment, pseudotumor cerebri, headaches, pseudotumor, cerebri, papilledema"
4,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left acoustic neuroma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , This patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma.  The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery.  She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins.  The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion.  Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified.  The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease.  The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use.,Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip.  Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone.  Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax.  Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure.  Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed.  The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly.  From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed.  Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use.  The bone flap was also left at the site for further use.  Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base.  Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus.  There was extensively aerated temporal bone.  At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor.  The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure.  Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone.  The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone.  Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out.  The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm.  There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well.  The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor.  The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult.  Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor.  With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem.  The eighth nerve was identified and transected.  Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem.  The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well.  It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve.  Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed.  The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus.  At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct.  The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated.  The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor.  The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face.  Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally.  However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated.  However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness.  It was released from the brainstem ventrally.  The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes.  Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume.  At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis.  The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax.  A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect.  Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal.  The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect.  Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels.  Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition.  All counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,100 mL.neurology, neuroma, bergen retractors, emissary veins, mayfield pins, acoustic, acoustic neuroma, cerebellopontine, craniotomy, facial nerve, periauricular, retrosigmoid, retrosigmoid craniotomy, internal auditory canal, porous acusticus, sigmoid sinus, auditory canal, bone, brainstem, nerve, postauricular, tumor"

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foreign body in airway.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Plastic piece foreign body in the right main stem bronchus.,PROCEDURE: , Rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This patient is 7-month-old baby boy who presented to emergency room today with increasing stridor and shortness of breath according to mom.  The patient had a chest x-ray and based on that there is concern by the Radiology it could be a foreign body in the right main stem.  The patient has been taken to the operating room for rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general mask anesthesia.  Using a 3.5 rigid bronchoscope we visualized between the cords into the trachea.  There were some secretions but that looked okay.  Got down at the level of the carina to see a foreign body flapping in the right main stem.  I then used graspers to grasp to try to pull into the scope itself.  I could not do that, I thus had to pull the scope out along with the foreign body that was held on to with a grasper.  It appeared to be consisting of some type of plastic piece that had broke off some different object.  I took the scope and put it back down into the airway again.  Again, there was secretion in the trachea that we suctioned out.  We looked down into the right bronchus intermedius.  There was no other pathology noted, just some irritation in the right main stem area.  I looked down the left main stem as well and that looked okay as well.  I then withdrew the scope.  Trachea looked fine as well as the cords.  I put the patient back on mask oxygen to wake the patient up.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.surgery, main stem bronchus, bronchoscopy, airway, foreign body removal, rigid bronchoscopy, "
2,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Metastatic ovarian cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic.  She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month.  She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000.  Her ANC was 0.5.  She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots.  She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.,Over the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily.  Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions.  She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fevers or chills.  However, she was complaining of chest pain.  She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it was nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.  There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox.  There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.,At this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY,1.

No evidence of tumor was found.,BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This is a 54-year-old female who was complaining of right hand numbness and tingling of the median distribution and has elected to undergo carpal tunnel surgery secondary to failure of conservative management.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative room and placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent a Bier block by the Department of Anesthesia on the upper extremity.  The upper extremity was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and left free.  Attention was drawn then to the palm of the hand.  We did identify area of incision that we would make, which was located over the carpal tunnel.,Approximately, 1.5 cm incision was made using a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was carried through the skin and fascia over the palm down to the carpal tunnel taking care during dissection to avoid any branches of nerves.  Carpal tunnel was then entered and the rest of the transverse carpal ligament was incised sharply with a #10 scalpel.  We inspected the median nerve and found that it was flat and compressed from the transverse carpal ligament.  We found no evidence of tumor or space occupying lesion in the carpal tunnel.  We then irrigated copiously.  Tourniquet was taken down at that time and pressure was held.  There was no evidence of obvious bleeders.  We approximated the skin with nylon and placed a postoperative dressing with a volar splint.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was placed back in the gurney and taken to PACU.orthopedic, carpal tunnel release, carpal tunnel syndrome, median nerve, bier block, carpal ligament, tunnel, carpal, transverse, median, "

Chronic eustachian tube dysfunction.,2.  Retained right pressure equalization tube.,3.  Retracted left tympanic membrane.,4.  Dizziness.,PROCEDURE:,1.  Removal of the old right pressure equalizing tube with placement of a tube.  Tube used was Santa Barbara.,2.  Myringotomy with placement of a left pressure equalizing tube.  The tube used was Santa Barbara.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,INDICATION: , This is a 98-year-old female whom I have known for several years.  She has a marginal hearing.  With the additional conductive loss secondary to the retraction of the tympanic membrane, her hearing aid and function deteriorated significantly.  So, we have kept sets of tubes in her ears at all times.  The major problem is that she has got small ear canals and a very sensitive external auditory canal; therefore it cannot tolerate even the wax cleaning in the clinic awake.,The patient was seen in the OR and tubes were placed.  There were no significant findings.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, she was brought to the neurosensory OR, placed under general anesthesia.  Mask airway was used.  IV had already been started.,On the right side, we removed the old tube and then cleaned the cerumen and found that it was larger than the side of the tube in perfection or perforation in tympanic membrane in the anterior inferior quadrant.  In the same area, a small Santa Barbara tube was placed.  This T-tube was cut to 80% of its original length for comfort and then positioned to point straight out and treated.  Three drops of ciprofloxacin eyedrops was placed in the ear canal.,On the left side, the tympanic membrane adhered and it was retracted and has some myringosclerosis.  Anterior, inferior incision was made.  Tympanic membrane bounced back to neutral position.  A Santa Barbara tube was cut to the 80% of the original length and placed in the hole.  Ciprofloxacin drops were placed in the ear.  Procedure completed.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,COMPLICATION: , None.,SPECIMEN:,  None.,DISPOSITION:,  To PACU in a stable condition.nan"

1,"DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral hypomastia.,NAME OF OPERATION:,  Bilateral transaxillary subpectoral mammoplasty with saline-filled implants.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,PROCEDURE: , After first obtaining a suitable level of general anesthesia with the patient in the supine position, the breasts were prepped with Betadine scrub and solution.  Sterile towels, sheets, and drapes were placed in the usual fashion for surgery of the breasts.  Following prepping and draping, the anterior axillary folds and the inframammary folds were infiltrated with a total of 20 cc of 0.5% Xylocaine with 1:200,000 units of epinephrine.,After a suitable hemostatic waiting period, transaxillary incisions were made, and dissection was carried down to the edge of the pectoralis fascia.  Blunt dissection was then used to form a bilateral subpectoral pocket.  Through the subpectoral pocket a sterile suction tip was introduced, and copious irrigation with sterile saline solution was used until the irrigant was clear.,Following completion of irrigation, 350-cc saline-filled implants were introduced.  They were first filled with 60 cc of saline and checked for gross leakage; none was evident.  They were over filled to 400 cc of saline each.  The patient was then placed in the seated position, and the left breast needed 10 cc of additional fluid for symmetry.,Following completion of the filling of the implants and checking the breasts for symmetry, the patient's wounds were closed with interrupted vertical mattress sutures of 4-0 Prolene.  Flexan dressings were applied followed by the patient's bra.,She seemed to tolerate the procedure well.surgery, bilateral transaxillary subpectoral mammoplasty, saline filled implants, subpectoral mammoplasty, mammoplasty, transaxillary, subpectoral, implants, breasts, saline, anesthesia"

Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation from C3 to C6 using a Synthes Small Stature Plate, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man has severe cervical spondylosis with myelopathy and cord compression at C5-C6.  There was a herniated disk with cord compression and radiculopathy at C4-C5.  C3-C4 was the source of neck pain as documented by facet injections.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the pros and cons of the surgery by two levels versus three levels.  Because of the severe component of the neck pain that has been relieved with facet injections, we elected to proceed ahead with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.,I explained the nature of this procedure in great detail including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understands and has no further questions and requests that I proceed.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated taking great care to keep the neck in a neutral position.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion dosages.,The left side of the neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the neck crease.  Dissection was carried down through the platysma musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscle were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  Caspar self-retaining pins were placed into the bodies of C3, C4, C5, and C6 and x-ray localization was obtained.  A needle was placed in what was revealed to be the disk space at C4-C5 and an x-ray confirmed proper localization.,Self-retaining retractors were then placed in the wound, taking great care to keep the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,First I removed the large amount of anterior overhanging osteophytes at C5-C6 and distracted the space.  The high-speed cutting bur was used to drill back the osteophytes towards the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.,An incision was then made at C4-C5 and the annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.,The retractors were then adjusted and again discectomy was performed at C3-C4 back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.  The operating microscope was then utilized.,Working under magnification, I started at C3-C4 and began to work my way down to the posterior longitudinal ligament.  The ligament was incised and the underlying dura was exposed.  I worked out laterally towards the takeoff of the C4 nerve root and widely decompressed the nerve root edge of the foramen.  There were a large number of veins overlying the nerve root which were oozing and rather than remove these and produce tremendous amount of bleeding, I left them intact.  However, I could to palpate the nerve root along the pedicle into the foramen and widely decompressed it on the right.  The microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved.,The retractors were readjusted and attention was turned to C4-C5.  I worked down through bony osteophytes and identified the posterior longitudinal ligament.  The ligament was incised; and as I worked to the right of the midline, I encountered herniated disk material which was removed in a number of large pieces.  The C5 root was exposed and then widely decompressed until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen.  The root had a somewhat high takeoff but I worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it.  Again the microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved.  Central decompression was achieved here where there was a moderate amount of spinal cord compression.  This was removed by undercutting with 1 and 2-mm Cloward punches.,Attention was then turned to the C5-C6 space.  Here there were large osteophytes projecting posteriorly against the cord.  I slowly and carefully used the high-speed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2-mm Cloward punches to widely decompress the spinal cord.  This necessitated undercutting the bodies of both C5 and C6 extensively, but I was then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord.  I exposed the C6 root and widely decompressed it until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right.  The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar decompression was achieved.,Attention was then turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  A high-speed Cornerstone bur was used to decorticate the bodies of C5-C6, C4-C5 and C3-C4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration.  Bone dust during the drilling was harvested for later use.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  Using the various Synthes sizers, I selected a 7-mm lordotic graft at C5-C6 and an 8-mm lordotic graft at C4-C5 and a 9-mm lordotic graft at C3-C4.  Each graft was filled with autologous bone from the vertebral bodies and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge.  I decided to use BMP in this case because there were three levels of fusion and because this patient has a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two weeks.  The BMP sponge and the ____________ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft.,Under distraction, the graft was placed at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 as described.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis.,Attention was turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation.  Various sizes of Synthes plates were selected until I decided that a 54-mm plate was appropriate.  The plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral bodies had to be drilled so that the plates would sit flush.  The holes were drilled and the screws were placed.  Eight screws were placed with two screws at C3, two screws at C4, two screws at C5, and two screws at C6.  All eight screws had good purchase.  The locking screws were tightly applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of the graft, plate, and screws.,Attention was turned to closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  A medium Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct.  There were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of disk material and bone and soft tissue.nan"

He was referred for a routine postop check angiogram.  He is doing fine clinically.  All questions were answered, risks explained, informed consent taken and patient was brought to angio suite.,TECHNIQUE: , After informed consent was taken patient was brought to angio suite, both groin sites were prepped and draped in sterile manner.  Patient was placed under general anesthesia for entire duration of the procedure.  Groin access was obtained with a stiff micropuncture wire and a 4-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush.  A 4-French angled Glide catheter was then taken up into the descending thoracic aorta was double flushed and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush.  The catheter was then taken up into the aortic arch and both common and internal carotid arteries were selectively catheterized followed by digital subtraction imaging in multiple projections.  The images showed spasm of the left internal carotid artery and the left A1, it was thought planned to infused papaverine into the ICA and the left A1.  After that the diagnostic catheter was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery.  SL-10 microcatheter was then prepped and was taken up with the support of Transcend platinum micro guide wire.  The microcatheter was then taken up into the internal carotid artery under biplane roadmapping and was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery and was pointed towards the A1.  60 mg of papaverine was then slowly infused into the internal carotid artery and the anterior cerebral artery.  Post-papaverine infusion images showed increased caliber of the internal carotid artery as well as the left A1.  The catheter was then removed from the patient, pressure was held for 10 minutes leading to hemostasis.  Patient was then transferred back to the ICU in the Children's Hospital where he was extubated without any deficits.,INTERPRETATION OF IMAGES:,1.  LEFT COMMON/INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTIONS:  The left internal carotid artery is of normal caliber.  In the intracranial projection there is moderate spasm of the left internal carotid artery and moderately severe spasm of the left A1.

4,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , New-onset seizure.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has undergone no surgical procedures.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.,General:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.,HEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.,Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.,Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.,Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.,Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.,Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then.nan"

Excision of granulation tissue tumor.,3.  Bronchial dilation with a balloon bronchoplasty, right main bronchus.,4.  Argon plasma coagulation to control bleeding in the trachea.,5.  Placement of a tracheal and bilateral bronchial stents with a silicon wire stent.,ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS:,1.  Normal true vocal cords.,2.  Proximal trachea with high-grade occlusion blocking approximately 90% of the trachea due to granulation tissue tumor and break down of metallic stent.,3.  Multiple stent fractures in the mid portion of the trachea with granulation tissue.,4.  High-grade obstruction of the right main bronchus by stent and granulation tissue.,5.  Left main bronchus was covered by the distal portion of the stent and was only being ventilated through the struts of the stent.,6.  All in all a high-grade terrible airway obstruction with involvement of the carina, left and right main stem bronchus, mid, distal, and proximal trachea.,TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was brought into the operating field.  A rapid sequence induction was done.  He was intubated with a rigid scope.  Jet ventilation technique was carried out using a rigid and flexible scope.  A thorough airway inspection was carried out with findings as described above.,Dr. D was present in the operating room and we conferred on operative strategy and agreed that the best of strategy would be to first dilate the right main bronchus, cauterize it to control bleeding and then piecemeal removed the stent from distal to proximal.  This is the technique that was carried out in a painstaking fashion removing bits of the stent piecemeal with finally getting all of the visible stent out of the airway.  It should be noted that Dr. Donovan and I felt that two of the metallic stents were probably in place but we cannot be sure because of the terrible anatomy and the fact that the stent pieces were coming out twisted metal in fragments.  Nevertheless, all the visible stent was removed, and the airway was much better after with the dilation of balloon and the rigid scope.  We took measurements and decided to place stents in the trachea, left and right main bronchus using a Dumon Y-stent.  It was measured 18 mm in tracheal diameter and 14 mm in bronchial diameter.  The right main stem stent was 2.25 cm in length, the left main stem stent was 3 cm in length and the tracheal portion was 9 cm in length.  After it was placed, excellent placement was achieved with the proximal end of the stent 3 cm below the true vocal cords.

After extended period of time, per the patient's family request and requested by the ICU staff, decision to place a feeding tube was decided and scheduled for today.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have esophagitis as well as gastritis via EGD and was placed on Prevacid granules.,PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  First, the EGD was to be performed.,The Olympus endoscope was inserted through the mouth, oropharynx and into the esophagus.  Esophagitis was noted.  The scope was then passed through the esophagus into the stomach.  The cardia, fundus, body, and antrum of the stomach were visualized.  There was evidence of gastritis.  The scope was passed into the duodenal bulb and sweep via the pylorus and then removed from the duodenum retroflexing on itself in the stomach looking at the hiatus.  Next, attention was made to transilluminating the anterior abdominal wall for the PEG placement.  The skin was then anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  The finder needle was then inserted under direct visualization.  The catheter was then grasped via the endoscope and the wire was pulled back up through the patient's mouth.  The Ponsky PEG tube was attached to the wire.  A skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel.  The wire was pulled back up through the abdominal wall point and Ponsky PEG back up through the abdominal wall and inserted into position.  The endoscope was then replaced confirming position.  Photograph was taken.  The Ponsky PEG tube was trimmed and the desired attachments were placed and the patient did tolerate the procedure well.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left pleural effusion.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left hemothorax.,PROCEDURE: , Thoracentesis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After obtaining informed consent and having explained the procedure to the patient, he was sat at the side of a stretcher in the emergency department.  His left back was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was used to infiltrate his chest wall and the chest entered upon the ninth intercostal space in the midscapular line and the thoracentesis catheter was used and placed, and then we proceed to draw by hand about 1200 mL blood.  This blood was nonclotting and it was tested twice.  Halfway during the procedure, the patient felt that he was getting dizzy and his pressure at that time had dropped to the 80s.  Therefore, we laid him off his right side while keeping the chest catheter in place.  At that time, I proceeded to continuously draw fluids slowly and then when the patient recovered we sat him up again and we proceed to complete the procedure.,Overall besides the described episode, the patient tolerated the procedure well and afterwards, we took another chest x-ray that showed much improvement in the pleural effusion and at that particular time, with all the history we proceeded to admit the patient for observation and with an idea to obtain a CT in the morning to see whether the patient would need an pigtail intrapleural catheter or not.surgery, pleural effusion, hemothorax, thoracentesis, chest,"

The patient was brought to the GI lab.  There, she was placed in partial left lateral decubitus position.  She was given IV sedation by Anesthesia.  Her abdomen was prepped with alcohol and then Betadine.  Flexible gastroscope was passed down the esophagus, through the stomach into the duodenum.  No lesions were noted in the duodenum.  There appeared to be a few polyps in the antral area, two in the antrum.  Actually, one appeared to be almost covering the pylorus.  The scope was withdrawn back into the antrum.  On retroflexion, we could see a large hiatal hernia.  No other lesions were noted.  Biopsy was taken of one of the polyps.  The scope was left in position.  Anterior abdominal wall was prepped with Betadine, 1% Xylocaine was injected in the left epigastric area.  A small stab incision was made and a large bore Angiocath was placed directly into the anterior abdominal wall, into the stomach, followed by a thread, was grasped with a snare using the gastroscope, brought out through the patient's mouth.  Tied to the gastrostomy tube, which was then pulled down and up through the anterior abdominal wall.  It was held in position with a dressing and a stent.  A connector was applied to the cut gastrostomy tube, held in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was returned to the floor in stable condition.surgery, antral, polyps, gastrostomy, endoscopic gastrostomy, hiatal hernia, abdominal wall, gastrostomy tube, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, malnutrition, dysphagia, abdominal"
4,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Comminuted left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with intraarticular extension.,PROCEDURE:,  Open reduction and internal fixation of left tibia.,ANESTHESIA: , General.  The patient received 10 ml of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 80 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimal.,DRAINS: , One JP drain was placed.,COMPLICATIONS: , No intraoperative complications or specimens.  Hardware consisted of two 4-5 K-wires, One 6.5, 60 mm partially threaded cancellous screw and one 45, 60 mm partially threaded cortical screw and 2 washers.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:,  The patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  The incision was then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage.  There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis.  This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible.  The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end.  The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s.  Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes.  JP drain was placed on the medium gutter.  The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes.  The patient was then placed in a knee mobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition.,POSTOP PLAN:  ,The patient hospitalized overnight to decrease swelling and as well as manage his pain.  He may weightbear as tolerated using knee mobilizer.  Postoperative findings relayed to the grandmother.  The patient will need subsequent hardware removal.  The patient also was given local anesthetic at the end of the case.orthopedic, intraarticular extension, tibial tubercle avulsion fracture, tubercle avulsion fracture, jp drain, cortical screw, hardware removal, tibial tubercle, tourniquet, orif, tubercle, tibial,"

Informed consent was obtained. On the day of surgery, (s)he received several sets of drops in the XXX eye including 2.5% phenylephrine, 1% Mydriacyl, 1% Cyclogyl, Ocuflox and Acular. (S)he was taken to the operating room and sedated via IV sedation. 2% lidocaine jelly was placed in the XXX eye (or, retrobulbar anesthesia was performed using a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% marcaine). The XXX eye was prepped using a 10% Betadine solution. (S)he was covered in sterile drapes leaving only the XXX eye exposed. A Lieberman lid speculum was placed to provide exposure. The Thornton fixation ring and a Superblade were used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 (or 11 depending upon side and handedness, and assuming superior incision) o'clock. Then 1% lidocaine was injected through the paracentesis. After the nonpreserved lidocaine was injected, Viscoat was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The Thornton fixation ring and a 2.75 mm keratome blade were used to create a two-step full-thickness clear corneal incision superiorly. The cystitome and Utrata forceps were used to create a continuous capsulorrhexis in the anterior lens capsule. BSS on a hydrodissection cannula was used to perform gentle hydrodissection. Phacoemulsification was then performed to remove the nucleus. I & A was performed to remove the remaining cortical material. Provisc was injected to fill the capsular bag and anterior chamber. A XXX diopter SN60AT (for Acrysof natural lens) intraocular lens was injected into the capsular bag. The Kuglen hook was used to rotate it into proper position in the capsular bag. I & A was performed to remove the remaining Viscoelastic material from the eye. BSS on the 30-gauge cannula was used to hydrate the wound. The wounds were checked and found to be watertight.

3,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today because he has not been feeling well.  He was in for a complete physical on 05/02/2008.  According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.general medicine, palpitations, nausea, loose stools, fatigue, related to anxiety, stress test, anxiety, "

Open reduction, right both bone forearm fracture with placement of long-arm cast.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,TOURNIQUET: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  25 mL.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient suffered injury at which time he fell over a concrete bench.  He landed mostly on the right arm.  He noted some bleeding at the time of the injury and a small puncture wound.  He was taken to the emergency room and diagnosed a compound both bone forearm fracture, and based on this, he was seen for malalignment.,He was indicated the above-noted procedure.  This procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure was discussed at length with the patient's parents and they understood them well.  Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain on full range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for repeat debridement, risk of need for internal fixation, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  They understood these well.  All questions were answered and they signed the consent for procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The right forearm was inspected.  There was noted to be a 3-mm puncture-type wound over the volar aspect of the forearm in the middle one-third overlying the radial one-half.  There was bleeding in this region.  No gross contamination was seen.  At this point, under fluoroscopic control, I did attempt to see a fracture.  I was unable to do the forearm under the close reduction techniques.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  An incision was made through the puncture wound site extending this proximally and distally.  There was noted to be some slight amount of nonviable tissue at the skin edge and debridement was required and performed.  I also did perform a light debridement of the nonviable subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and small bony fragments were also removed.  These were all completely debrided appropriately and then at this point, a thorough irrigation was performed of the radius, which I communicated through the puncture wound.  Both ends were clearly visualized, and thorough irrigation was performed using total of 6 L of antibiotic solution.  All nonviable gross contaminated tissue was removed.  At this point with the bones in direct visualization, I did reduce the bony ends to anatomic alignment with excellent bony approximation.  Proper alignment of tissue and angulation was confirmed.,At this point, under fluoroscopic control confirmed the radius and ulna in anatomic position, which will be completely displaced and shortened previously.  The ulna was now also noted to be in anatomic alignment.,At this point, the region was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis confirmed and closure then begun.  The skin was reapproximated using 3-0 nylon suture.  The visual puncture wound region was left open and this was intact with the depth of the wound down the bone using 1.5-inch Nugauze with iodoform.  Sterile dressing applied and a long-arm cast with the forearm in neutral position was applied.  X-ray with fluoroscopic evaluation was performed, which confirmed.  They maintained excellent bony approximation and the anatomic alignment.  The long-arm cast was then completely mature.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was then taken to the recovery room in stable condition.orthopedic, compound fracture, mid-shaft radius, ulna, open reduction, irrigation and debridement, subcutaneous, tissues, muscle, bone, forearm, radius and ulna, forearm fracture, anatomic alignment, arm cast, puncture wound, tourniquet, i&d, fracture,"
3,"ENDOVASCULAR BRACHYTHERAPY (EBT),The patient is to undergo a course of angioplasty for in-stent restenosis.  The radiotherapy will be planned using simulation films when the Novoste system catheter markers are placed on either side of the coronary artery injury site.  After this, a calculation will take place to determine the length of time at which the strontium sources will be left in place to deliver an adequate dose given the reference vessel diameter.  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiological principles that make this type of therapy more effective than blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy.  The does per fraction is individualized for each patient according to radiobiological principles and reference vessel diameter.  Given that this is a very high dose rate source and the chances of severe acute toxicity such as cardiac ischemia and machine malfunction are present, it is imperative that the patient be followed closely by myself and monitored for ST segment elevation and correct machine function.cardiovascular / pulmonary, endovascular brachytherapy, ebt, angioplasty, stent, vessel, atherectomy, endovascular, brachytherapyNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

She had her first C-section because of congenial hip problems.  In her second C-section, baby was breached, therefore, she is scheduled for a third C-section.  The patient also requests sterilization.  Therefore, she requested a tubal ligation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where a spinal with Astramorph anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made removing the old scar with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was excised in the midline extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  There was noted dense adhesions at this point as well as a wire mesh was noted.  The anterior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle superiorly was opened with a hemostat.  The peritoneum was identified and entered bluntly digitally.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly up to the level of the mesh.  Then, inferiorly using the knife, the adhesions were taken down and the bladder was identified and the peritoneum incision extended inferiorly to the level of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted and vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and tented up with Allis clamps and bladder flap was created sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted to protect the bladder and the uterine incision was made with a first knife and then extended laterally with the Bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was noted to be clear.  At this point, upon examining the intrauterine contents, the baby was noted to be breached.  The right foot was identified and then the baby was delivered from the double footling breach position without any difficulty.  The cord was clamped and the baby was then handed off to awaiting pediatricians.  The placenta cord gases were obtained and the placenta was then manually extracted from the uterus.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  Then, the uterine incision was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a double closure stitch fashion, first layer in locking stitch fashion and the second layer an imbricating layer.  Attention at this time was turned to the tubes bilaterally.,Both tubes were isolated and followed all the way to the fimbriated end and tented up with the Babcock clamp.  The hemostat was probed through the mesosalpinx in the avascular area and then a section of tube was clamped off with two hemostats and then transected with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The ends was then burned with the cautery and then using a #2-0 Vicryl suture tied down.  Both tube sections were noted to be hemostatic and the tubes were then sent to pathology for review.  The uterus was then replaced back into the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was then once again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The bladder flap was then replaced back into the uterus with #3-0 interrupted sutures.  The peritoneum was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Then, the area at the fascia where the mesh had been cut and approximately 0.5 cm portion was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple stitch fashion.  The fascia was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous layer and Scarpa's fascia were repaired with a #3-0 Vicryl.  Then, the skin edges were reapproximated using sterile clips.  The dressing was placed.  The uterus was then cleared of all clots and debris manually.  Then, the patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle, counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to recovery in sable condition.  She will be followed up throughout her hospital stay.nan"

He complained of pain on the medial aspect of his right knee after an injury at work, which he twisted his right knee.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the operative surgeon, the patient, the Department of Anesthesia and the nursing staff.,The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #2, placed on the operating table in supine position.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  The right lower extremity was then properly positioned in a Johnson knee holder.  At this time, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 20 cc was administered to the right knee intra-articularly under sterile conditions.  The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Next, after all bony soft tissue landmarks were identified, an inferolateral working portal was established by making a 1-cm transverse incision at the level of the joint line lateral to the patellar tendon.  The cannula and trocar were then inserted through this, putting the patellofemoral joint.  An arthroscopic camera was then inserted and the knee was sequentially examined including the patellofemoral joint, the medial and lateral gutters, medial lateral joints, and the femoral notch.  Upon viewing of the patellofemoral joint, there was noted to be grade-II chondromalacia changes of the patella.  There were no loose bodies noted in the either gutter.  Upon viewing of the medial compartment, there was no chondromalacia or meniscal tear was noted.  While in this area, attention was directed to establish the inferomedial instrument portal.  This was first done using a spinal needle for localization followed by 1-cm transverse incision at the joint line.  A probe was then inserted through this portal and the meniscus was further probed.  Again, there was noted to be no meniscal tear.  The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no chondromalacia.  Upon viewing of the femoral notch, there was noted to be intact ACL with negative drawer sign.  PCL was also noted to be intact.  Upon viewing of the lateral compartment, there was noted to be a large bucket-handle tear involving the lateral and posterior horns.  It was reduced from the place, however, involved the white and red white area was elected to excise the bucket-handle.  An arthroscopic scissor was then inserted and the two remaining attachments the posterior and lateral attachments were then clipped and a Schlesinger grasper was then used to remove the resected meniscus.  It was noted that the meniscus was followed out to the whole and the entire piece was taken out of the knee.  Pictures were taken both pre-meniscal resection and post-meniscal resection.  The arthroscopic shaver was then inserted into the medial portal and the remaining meniscus was contoured.  The lateral gutter was then examined and was noted to be no loose bodies and ______ was intact.  Next, attention was directed to the inner surface of the patella.  This was debrided using the 2.5 arthroscopic shaver.  It was noted to be quite smooth and postprocedure the patient was taken ________ well.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry and all instrumentation was removed.  20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then administered to each portal as well as intra-articularly.,Sterile dressing was then applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril and a stockinette to the right lower extremity.

Distal nasolacrimal duct stenosis with obstruction, right eye.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Bilateral nasolacrimal probing.,ANESTHESIA: , Monitored anesthesia care along with mask sedation.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: , This young infant is a 19-month-old who has had persistent tearing and mild eyelash encrustation of each eye for many months.  Conservative measures at home have failed to completely resolve the symptoms.  He has been placed on previous antibiotics treatment for presumed conjunctivitis.  Please refer to clinic note for more details.  Conservative measures at home have failed to resolve the symptoms.  A nasolacrimal probing was offered as an elective procedure.  Procedure as well as inherent risks, expected outcomes, benefits, and alternatives (including continued observation) were discussed with his mother prior to scheduling surgery.  Again, a description of procedure as well as diagram instruction was provided to mother and father in the morning of the procedure.  The risks as explained included, but were not limited to temporary bleeding, persistent symptoms, recurrence need for further procedure, possible need for future stent placement or repeat probing, and anesthesia risk were all discussed.  Also a rare possibility of errant passage of the nasolacrimal probe was discussed.  Preoperative evaluation and explanation include drying of the nasolacrimal system with an explanation expected outcome/result from surgery.  No guarantees were offered.  Informed consent was signed and placed on the chart.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  Procedure as well as inherent risks were again discussed with parents prior to the procedure.  After anesthesia was induced in the operating room, tetracaine drops were applied to each eye and the pressure of the eyes were checked with Tono-Pen.  The pressure on the right was 17 mmHg and on the left was 16 mmHg.,A punctal dilator was then used to dilate the left superior puncta.  A size 00 Bowman probe was used to navigate the superior puncta and canaliculus with traction of the eyelid temporally.  The probe was advanced until a firm stop of the lacrimal bone was felt.  The probe was rotated in a superior and medial fashion along the brow to allow for navigation through the nasolacrimal sac and duct.  A mild resistance was felt at the distal aspect of the nasolacrimal duct consistent with a location of the valve.  There was also some mild stenosis distally, but not felt significant.  The probe was used to navigate through this mild resistance.  A second Bowman probe was then placed through the left naris and metal on metal contact was felt confirming patency.  Both probes were removed.  The 00 Bowman probe was then used to navigate the inferior puncta canaliculus system.  Patency was confirmed.  The left upper lid was everted and inspected and was found to be normal.,Attention was then turned to the right side where the similar procedure through the right superior puncta was performed.  A punctal dilator was used to dilate the puncta followed by a size 00 Bowman probe.  Again on this side, a size 0 Bowman probe was unable to be placed initially to the superior puncta.  The probe was used to navigate the superior puncta, canaliculus, and then the probe was rotated superomedially and the probe was advanced.  Similar amount of distal stenosis and distal nasolacrimal duct obstruction was felt.  The mild resistance was over come at the approximate location of the valve.  Metal-on-metal feel confirmed patency through the right naris with a second metal probe.  At the completion of the procedure all probes were removed.  Awakened and taken to the postanesthesia recovery unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Postoperative instructions were provided to the parents by me, and the discharging nurse.  I did advised nasolacrimal massage for the next 7 to 10 days on each side two to three times daily.  Technique explained and demonstrated.

Excision, soft tissue fullness of the lateral abdomen and flank.,3.  Liposuction of the supraumbilical abdomen.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:,  The patient is a 31-year-old white female who previously has undergone latissimus dorsi flap and implant, breast reconstruction.  She now had lateralization of the implant with loss of medial fullness for which she desired correction.  It was felt that mobilization of the implant medially would provide the patient significant improvement and this was discussed with the patient at length.  The patient also had a small dog ear in the flank area on the right from the latissimus flap harvest, which was to be corrected.  She had also had liposuction of the periumbilical and infraumbilical abdomen with desire to have great improvement superiorly, was felt to be a candidate for such.  The above-noted procedure was discussed with the patient in detail.  The risks, benefits and potential complications were discussed.  She was marked in the upright position and then taken to the operating room for the above-noted procedure.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Following adequate induction of general LMA anesthesia, the chest and abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The supraumbilical abdomen was then injected with a solution of 5% lidocaine with epinephrine, as was the dog ear.  At this time, the superior central scar was then excised, dissection continued through the subcutaneous tissue, the underlying latissimus muscle until the capsule of the implant was reached.  This was then opened.  The implant was removed and placed on the back table in antibiotic solution.  Using Bovie cautery, the medial capsule was released and undermining was then performed with release of the muscle to the level of the proposed medial projection of the breast.  The inframammary fold medially was secured with 2-0 PDS suture to create greater takeoff point at this level which in the upright position and using a sizer produced a good form.  The lateral pocket was diminished by series of 2-0 PDS suture to provide medialization of the implant.  The implant was then placed back into the submuscular pocket with much improved positioning and medial fullness.  With this completed, the implant was again removed, antibiotic irrigation was performed.  A drain was placed and brought out through a separate inferior stab wound incision and hemostasis was confirmed.  The implant was then replaced and the wound was then closed in layers using 2-0 PDS running suture on the muscle and 3-0 Monocryl Dermabond subcuticular sutures.  The 2.5 cm dog ear was then excised into and including the subcutaneous tissue, even contouring was achieved and this was closed with two layers using 3-0 Monocryl suture.  Using a #3 cannula, a superior umbilical incision, liposuction was carried out into the supraumbilical abdomen, removing approximately 40 to 50 mL of fat with improved supraumbilical contours.  This was closed with 6-0 Prolene suture.  The patient was placed in a compressive garment after treating the incision with Dermabond, Steri-Strips and antibiotic ointment around the drain site and umbilicus.  A Kerlix dressing and a surgical bra was placed to the chest area.  A compressive garment was placed.  The patient was then aroused from anesthesia, extubated, and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Sponge, needle, lap, instrument counts were all correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.

1,"Initially a small incision was made in the right superior hemiscrotum and the incision was carried down to the vas deferens.  This incision was carried down to the area of the previous vasectomy.  A towel clip was placed around this.  Next the scarred area was dissected free back to normal vas proximally and distally.  Approximately 4 cm of vas was freed up.  Next the vas was amputated above and below the scar tissue.  Fine hemostats were used to grasp the adventitial tissue on each side of the vas, both the proximal and distal ends.  Both ends were then dilated very carefully with lacrimal duct probes up to a #2 successfully.  After accomplishing this, fluid could be milked from the proximal vas which was encouraging.,Next the reanastomosis was performed.  Three 7-0 Prolene were used and full thickness bites were taken through the muscle layer of the vas deferens and into the lumen.  This was all done with 3.5 loupe magnification.  Next the vas ends were pulled together by tying the sutures.  A good reapproximation was noted.  Next in between each of these sutures two to three of the 7-0 Prolenes were used to reapproximate the muscularis layer further in an attempt to make this fluid-tight.,There was no tension on the anastomosis and the vas was delivered back into the right hemiscrotum.  The subcuticular layers were closed with a running 3-0 chromic and the skin was closed with three interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.,Next an identical procedure was done on the left side.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was awakened and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.

1,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.

Open laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  ,This is a 62-year-old female with a history of right ureteropelvic junction obstruction with chronic indwelling double-J ureteral stent.  The patient presents for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operative suite and administered general anesthetic.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion after building up the right side of the OR table to aid in the patient's positioning for bowel retraction.  Hassan technique was performed for the initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region.  Abdominal insufflation was performed.  There were significant adhesions noted.  A second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a Harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially.  The kidney was able to be palpated within Gerota's fascia.  The psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  The uterus was grasped with a Babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  The renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  There was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  We were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed.  The renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  Fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and Bovie cautery.  The tissue was sent down to Pathology for analysis.  Please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  Ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  The renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  At this point, the indwelling double-J ureteral stent was removed.  At this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 Vicryl suture was placed.  This was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  The back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, a double-J stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder.  The anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running Vicryl suture.  Renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place.  Please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue.  This was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 Vicryl.  FloSeal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this.  A good hemostasis was noted.  A #10 Blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis.  The initial trocar incision was closed with #0 Vicryl suture.  The abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 Vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin edges were then closed with staples.

2,"CAUSE OF DEATH:,1.  Acute respiratory failure.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:,1.  Acute respiratory failure, probably worsened by aspiration.,2.  Acute on chronic renal failure.,3.  Non-Q wave myocardial infarction.,4.  Bilateral lung masses.,5.  Occlusive carotid disease.,6.  Hypertension.,7.  Peripheral vascular disease.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,This 80-year-old patient with a history of COPD had had recurrent admissions over the past few months.  The patient was admitted again on 12/15/08, after he had been discharged the previous day.  Came in with acute on chronic respiratory failure, with CO2 of 57.  The patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation.  RVR with a rapid ventricular response of 160 beats per minute.  The patient was on COPD exacerbation and CHF due to rapid atrial fibrillation.  The patient's heart rate was controlled with IV Cardizem.  Troponin was consistent with non-Q wave MI.  The patient was treated medically transfer to catheterize the patient to evaluate her coronary artery disease.  Echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction, normal left and right side, but stage 3 restrictive physiology.  There was also prosthetic aortic valve.  The patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit and was intubated.  Pulmonary was managed by Critical Care, Dr. X.,The patient was successfully extubated.  Was tapered from IV steroids and put on p.o. steroids.  The patient's renal function has stabilized with a creatinine of between 2.1 and 2.3.  There was contemplation as to whether left heart catheterization should proceed since Nephrology was concerned about the patient's renal status.  Wife decided catheterization should be canceled and the patient managed conservatively.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor.  While in telemetry floor, the patient's renal function started deteriorating, went up from 2.08 to 2.67 in two days.  The patient had nausea and vomiting.  Was unable to tolerate p.o.  Was put on cautious hydration.  The patient went into acute respiratory distress.  Intubation showed the patient had aspirated.  He was in acute respiratory failure with bronchospasms and exacerbation of COPD.  X-ray of chest did not show any infiltrate, but showed dilatation of the stomach.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit because of acute respiratory failure, was intubated by Critical Care, Dr. X.  The patient was put on the vent.  Overnight, the patient's condition did not improve.  Continued to be severely hypoxic.,The patient expired on the morning of 12/24/08 from acute respiratory failure.discharge summary, myocardial infarction, intensive care unit, acute respiratory failure, death summary, atrial fibrillation, renal function, telemetry floor, respiratory failure, death, chronic, exacerbation, infarction, respiratory"
3,"PROCEDURE: , Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and colonoscopy with biopsy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , A 17-year-old with history of 40-pound weight loss, abdominal pain, status post appendectomy with recurrent abscess formation and drainage.  Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.  It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall.  CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease.  Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease.,MEDICATIONS:  ,General anesthesia.,INSTRUMENT:,  Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FINDINGS: , With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia.  The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors.  It appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  Rugal folds were flattened completely.  There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach.  The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology.  Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing.  Excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.,The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy.  Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge.  The colonic clean out was excellent.  The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum.  The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm.  No fistulas were noted in the colon.  Excess air was evacuated from the colon.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.,IMPRESSION: , Normal esophagus and duodenum.  There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve.  All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease.,PLAN:  ,Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily.  Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results.  If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion.  We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy.  Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate.  We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula.  He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy.  If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy.gastroenterology, olympus gif-160, pcf-160, endoscopy, crohn's disease, aphthous ulcers, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscope, esophagus, duodenum, mucosal, stomach, biopsies, colonoscopy"

1,"PROCEDURE: , Endotracheal intubation.,INDICATION: , Respiratory failure.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic osteogenic sarcoma.  He was admitted two days ago with small bowel obstruction.  He has been on Coumadin for previous PE and currently on heparin drip.  He became altered and subsequently deteriorated quite rapidly to the point where he is no longer breathing on his own and has minimal responsiveness.  A code blue was called.  On my arrival, the patient's vital signs are stable.  His blood pressure is systolically in 140s and heart rate 80s.  He however has 0 respiratory effort and is unresponsive to even painful stimuli.  The patient was given etomidate 20 mg.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient positioned appropriate equipment at the bedside, given 20 mg of etomidate and 100 mg of succinylcholine.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right frontotemporal chronic subacute subdural hematoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right frontotemporal chronic subacute subdural hematoma.,TITLE OF THE OPERATION: , Right frontotemporal craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma, biopsy of membranes, microtechniques.,ASSISTANT: , None.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 75-year-old man with a 6-week history of decline following a head injury.  He was rendered unconscious by the head injury.  He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi.  This workup was negative.  The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker.  The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma.  There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes.  I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity.  The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion.  There was a roll beneath the right shoulder.  The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia.  Weitlaner retractors were inserted.  A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle.  I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis.  A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm.  The bone was set aside.  The dura was clearly discolored and very tense.  The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade.  There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure.  Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity.  The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section.  The margins of the membrane were coagulated.  The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none.  The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon.  Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers.  Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.,FINDINGS: , Chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane.,I might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure.  Also, it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood.neurosurgery, frontotemporal, weitlaner, calvarium, cookie cutter type, craniotomy, dura, frontotemporal craniotomy, galea, hematoma, subdural, subdural hematoma, syncopal, temporalis, subacute subdural hematoma, temporalis muscle,"

His confidence and self-esteem are significantly low.  He stated he has excessive somnolence, his energy level is extremely low, motivation is low, and he has a lack for personal interests.  He has had suicidal ideation, but this is currently in remission.  Furthermore, he continues to have hopeless thoughts and crying spells.  Mr. T stated these symptoms appeared approximately two months ago.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , On March 25, 2003, Mr. T was fired from his job secondary, to an event at which he stated he was first being harassed by another employee."" This other, employee had confronted Mr. T with a very aggressive, verbal style, where this employee had placed his face directly in front of Mr. T was spitting on him, and called him ""bitch."" Mr. T then retaliated, and went to hit the other employee.  Due to this event, Mr. T was fired.  It should be noted that Mr. T stated he had been harassed by this individual for over a year and had reported the harassment to his boss and was told to ""deal with it."",There are no other apparent stressors in Mr. T's life at this time or in recent months.  Mr. T stated that work was his entire life and he based his entire identity on his work ethic.  It should be noted that Mr. T was a process engineer for Plum Industries for the past 14 years.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  There is no evidence of any psychiatric hospitalizations or psychiatric interventions other than a recent visit to Mr. T's family physician, Dr. B at which point Mr. T was placed on Lexapro with an unknown dose at this time.

Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.,Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.  He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years.  Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993.  He has a son who is currently 20 years old.  After being a home maker, Mr. T worked for his mother in a restaurant, and moved on from there to work for Borg-Warner corporation for one to two years before beginning at Plum Industries, where he worked for 14 years and worked his way up to lead engineer.,Mental Status Exam:  Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense.  At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.,He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.

His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.,There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.

The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.psychiatry / psychology, muscle tremor, headaches, excessive nervousness, poor concentration, independent medical evaluation, psychopharmacologic, poor ability to focus, major depressive disorder, tremor, depressive, psychiatric, "

Degenerative osteoarthritis of acromioclavicular joint, left shoulder.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Arthroscopy with arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement.,2.  Anterior acromioplasty.,3.  Mumford procedure left shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operative Suite, Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done in a modified beach chair position with interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 38-year-old morbidly obese white male suffering increasing pain in his left shoulder for a number of months prior to surgical intervention.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting.  After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side.  All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum.  The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact.  Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis.  Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in.  A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out.  Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff.  Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness.,Attention was then turned to the subacromial region.  The scope was directed subacromially.  A portal was created laterally.  Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver.  #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this.,It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200.  Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure.  Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured.  An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation.  Flaps were created.  Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly.  Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp.  An excellent decompression was present.  CA ligament had been previously resected.  We then took the incision over the distal clavicle.  The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw.  The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges.  Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl.  Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same.  A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing.  0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure.  Pain buster catheter was hooked up.  The patient's arm was placed in arm sling.  He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.orthopedic, slap lesion, acromioclavicular joint, impingement syndrome, mumford procedure, acromioplasty, arthroscopy, arthroscopic, arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement, anterior acromioplasty, rotator cuff tear, arthroscopic rotator, meniscal shaver, cuff tear, rotator cuff, debridement, osteoarthritis, acromioclavicular, clavicle, deltoid, rotator, cuff, shoulder, joint"

Posterior spinal fusion at the level of L4-L5 and L5-S1 utilizing local bone graft, allograft and segmental instrumentation.,3.  Posterior lumbar interbody arthrodesis utilizing cage instrumentation at L4-L5 with local bone graft and allograft.  All procedures were performed under SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitoring.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Approximately 1000 cc.,CELL SAVER RETURNED:  ,Approximately 550 cc.,SPECIMENS: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DRAIN: , 8-inch Hemovac.,SURGICAL INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 59-year-old male who had severe disabling low back pain.  He had previous lumbar laminectomy at L4-L5.  He was noted to have an isthmic spondylolisthesis.,Previous lumbar laminectomy exacerbated this condition and made it further unstable.  He is suffering from neurogenic claudication.  He was unresponsive to extensive conservative treatment.  He has understanding of the risks, benefits, potential complications, treatment alternatives and provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 where he was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  He was subsequently placed prone on the Jackson's spinal table with all bony prominences well padded.  His lumbar spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A previous midline incision was extended from approximate level of L3 to S1.  This was in the midline.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  ,Electrocautery was utilized to dissect through subcutaneous tissue of lumbar fascia.  The lumbar fascia was identified and split in the midline.  Subperiosteal dissection was then carried out with electrocautery and ______ elevated from the suspected levels of L3-S1.  Once this was exposed, the transverse processes, a Kocher clamp was placed and a localizing cross-table x-ray confirmed the interspace between the spinous processes of L3-L4.  Once this was completed, a self-retaining retractor was then placed.  With palpation of the spinous processes, the L4 posterior elements were noted to be significantly loosened and unstable.  These were readily mobile with digital palpation.  A rongeur was then utilized to resect the spinous processes from the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  This bone was morcellized and placed on the back table for utilization for bone grafting.  The rongeur was also utilized to thin the laminas from the inferior half of L3 to superior half of S1.  Once this was undertaken, the unstable posterior elements of L4 were meticulously dissected free until wide decompression was obtained.  Additional decompression was extended from the level of the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  The microscope was utilized during this portion of procedure for visualization.  There was noted to be no changes during the decompression portion or throughout the remainder of the surgical procedure.  Once decompression was deemed satisfactory, the nerve roots were individually inspected and due to the unstable spondylolisthesis, there was noted to be tension on the L4 and L5 nerve roots crossing the disc space at L4-L5.  Once this was identified, foraminotomies were created to allow additional mobility.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  Working type screws, provisional titanium screws were then placed at L4-l5.  This was to allow distraction and reduction of the spondylolisthesis.  These were placed in the pedicles of L4 and L5 under direct intensification.  The position of the screws were visualized, both AP and lateral images.  They were deemed satisfactory.,Once this was completed, a provisional plate was applied to the screws and distraction applied across L4-L5.  This allowed for additional decompression of the L5 and L4 nerve roots.  Once this was completed, the L5 nerve root was traced and deemed satisfactory exiting neural foramen after additional dissection and discectomy were performed.  Utilizing a series of interbody spacers, a size 8 mm spacer was placed within the L4-L5 interval.  This was taken in sequence up to a 13 mm space.  This was then reduced to a 11 mm as it was much more anatomic in nature.  Once this was completed, the spacers were then placed on the left side and distraction obtained.  Once the distraction was obtained to 11 mm, the interbody shavers were utilized to decorticate the interbody portion of L4 and L5 bilaterally.  Once this was taken to 11 mm bilaterally, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  A 11 mm height x 9 mm width x 25 mm length carbon fiber cages were packed with local bone graft and Allograft.  There were impacted at the interspace of L4-L5 under direct image intensification.  Once these were deemed satisfactory, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The provisional screws and plates were removed.  This allowed for additional compression along L4-L5 with the cage instrumentation.  Permanent screws were then placed at L4, L5, and S1 bilaterally.  This was performed under direct image intensification.  The position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, the posterolateral gutters were decorticated with an AM2 Midas Rex burr down to bleeding subchondral bone.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The morcellized Allograft and local bone graft were mixed and packed copiously from the transverse processes of L4-S1 bilaterally.  A 0.25 inch titanium rod was contoured of appropriate length to span from L4-S1.  Appropriate cross connecters were applied and the construct was placed over the pedicle screws.  They were tightened and sequenced to allow additional posterior reduction of the L4 vertebra.  Once this was completed, final images in the image intensification unit were reviewed and were deemed satisfactory.  All connections were tightened and retightened in Torque 2 specifications.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The dura was inspected and noted to be free of tension.  At the conclusion of the procedure, there was noted to be no changes on the SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitors.  An 8-inch Hemovac drain was placed exiting the wound.  The lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl in interrupted fashion, the subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, surgical stainless steel clips were used to approximate the skin.  The remainder of the Hemovac was assembled.  Bulky compression dressing utilizing Adaptic, 4x4, and ABDs was then affixed to the lumbar spine with Microfoam tape.  He was turned and taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded.nan"

Then a retrobulbar injection of 2% Xylocaine was performed.  A lid speculum was applied and the conjunctiva was opened 4 mm from the limbus.  A 2-0 traction suture was passed around the insertion of the lateral rectus and the temporal one-half of the globe was exposed.  Next, the plaque was identified and the two scleral sutures were removed.  The plaque was gently extracted and the conjunctiva was re-sutured with 6-0 catgut, following removal of the traction suture.  The fundus was inspected with direct ophthalmoscopy.  An eye patch was applied following Neosporin solution irrigation.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Open, displaced, infected left atrophic mandibular fracture; failed dental implant.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Open, displaced, infected left atrophic mandibular fracture; failed dental implant.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left atrophic mandibular fracture, removal of failed dental implant from the left mandible.,ANESTHESIA: , General nasotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 125 mL.,FLUIDS GIVEN: , 1 L of crystalloids.,SPECIMEN: , Soft tissue from the fracture site sent for histologic diagnosis.,CULTURES: , Also sent for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic, culture and sensitivity.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 79-year-old male, who fell in his hometown, following an episode of syncope.  He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.  The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin.  A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs.  Estimated blood loss is 125 mL.surgery, atrophic mandibular fracture, dental implant, open reduction and internal fixation, orif, mandibular fracture, mandible, atrophic, mandibular, dental, implant,"

She would usually have pustular type of lesion that would eventually break and would be quite painful.  The drainage would be malodorous.  It would initially not be infected as far as she knows, but then could eventually become infected.  She stated that this first started after she had her first born about 2 years ago.  She had recurrences of these abscesses and had pain, actually hospitalized at Hospital approximately a year and a half ago for about 1-1/2 months.  She was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics.  She had biopsies done.  She was seen by Dr. X.  Reportedly, she had a HIV test done that was negative.  She had been seen by a dermatologist who said that she had a problem with her sweat glands.  She has been on multiple courses of antibiotics.  She never had any fevers.  She has pain, drainage, and reportedly there was some bleeding in the area of the perineum/vaginal area.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  History of recurrent abscesses in the perineum, upper medial thigh, and the vulva area for about 2 years.

2,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Low Back Syndrome - Low back pain with left greater than right lower extremity radiculopathy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Same.,PROCEDURE:,1.  Nerve root decompression at L45 on the left side.,2.  Tun-L catheter placement with injection of steroid solution and Marcaine at L45 nerve roots left.,3.  Interpretation of radiograph.,ANESTHESIA: , IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  None.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: , Severe and excruciating pain in the lumbar spine and lower extremity.  MRI shows disc pathology as well as facet arthrosis.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was admitted to the operating room, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.,After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.

1,"OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES,1.  Insertion of right internal jugular Tessio catheter.,2.  Placement of left wrist primary submental arteriovenous fistula.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring lines were placed.  The right neck, chest and left arm were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A small incision was made at the top of the anterior jugular triangle in the right neck.  Through this small incision, the right internal jugular vein was punctured and a guidewire was placed.  It was punctured a 2nd time, and a 2nd guidewire was placed.  The Tessio catheters were assembled.  They were measured for length.  Counter-incisions were made on the right chest.  They were then tunneled through these lateral chest wall incisions to the neck incision, burying the Dacron cuffs.  They were flushed with saline.  A suture was placed through the guidewire, and the guidewire and dilator were removed.  The arterial catheter was then placed through this, and the tear-away introducer was removed.  The catheter aspirated and bled easily.  It was flushed with saline and capped.  This was repeated with the venous line.  It also aspirated easily and was flushed with saline and capped.  The neck incision was closed with a 4-0 Tycron, and the catheters were sutured at the exit sites with 4-0 nylon.  Dressings were applied.  An incision was then made at the left wrist.  The basilic vein was dissected free, as was the radial artery.  Heparin was given, 50 mg.  The radial artery was clamped proximally and distally with a bulldog.  It was opened with a #11 blade and Potts scissors, and stay sutures of 5-0 Prolene were placed.  The vein was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  It was sutured to the radial artery with a running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The clamps were removed.  Good flow was noted through the artery.  Protamine was given, and the wound was closed with interrupted 3-0 Dexon subcutaneous and a running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular on the skin.

1,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED,1.  Placement of a subclavian single-lumen tunneled Hickman central venous catheter.,2.  Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and anesthesia was administered.  Next, a #18-gauge needle was used to locate the subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, a J wire was inserted through the needle using Seldinger technique.  The needle was withdrawn.  The distal tip location of the J wire was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next, a separate stab incision was made approximately 3 fingerbreadths below the wire exit site.  A subcutaneous tunnel was created, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was pulled through the tunnel to the level of the cuff.  The catheter was cut to the appropriate length.  A dilator and sheath were passed over the J wire.  The dilator and J wire were removed, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was threaded through the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The distal tip was confirmed to be in good location with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  A 2-0 nylon was used to secure the cuff down to the catheter at the skin level.  The skin stab site was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral progressive conductive hearing losses with probable otosclerosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral conductive hearing losses with right stapedial fixation secondary to otosclerosis.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Right argon laser assisted stapedectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room.  Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution.  A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon.  This could later be removed in bishop.  A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished.  A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock.  Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation.  Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus.  An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament.  The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain.  Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified.  Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement.  A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani.  The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well.  The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse.  The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured.  The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation.  A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston.  The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen.  It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate.  The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate.  A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus.  Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position.  Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph.  A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction.  The mobility appeared excellent.  The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position.  The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment.  She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop.  Sutures will be out in a week and a recheck in Reno in four to five weeks from now.surgery, bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss, argon laser assisted, conductive hearing losses, intubation, argon, stapedectomy, otosclerosis, canal, earlobe, prosthesis, pledgets, laser"

The right inguinal region was shaved and prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  The patient received 1 gm of Ancef IV push.,Transverse incision was made in the intraabdominal crease and carried through skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The external oblique fascia was exposed and incised down to and through the external inguinal ring.  The spermatic cord and hernia sac were dissected bluntly off the undersurface of the external oblique fascia exposing the attenuated floor of the inguinal canal.  The cord was surrounded with a Penrose drain.  The hernia sac was separated from the cord structures.  The floor of the inguinal canal, which consisted of attenuated transversalis fascia, was imbricated upon itself with a running locked suture of 2-0 Prolene.  Marlex patch 1 x 4 in dimension was trimmed to an appropriate shape with a defect to accommodate the cord.  It was placed around the cord and sutured to itself with 2-0 Prolene.  The patch was then sutured medially to the pubic tubercle, inferiorly to Cooper's ligament and inguinal ligaments, and superiorly to conjoined tendon using 2-0 Prolene.  The area was irrigated with saline solution, and 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine was injected to provide prolonged postoperative pain relief.  The cord was returned to its position.  External oblique fascia was closed with a running 2-0 PDS, subcu with 2-0 Vicryl, and skin with running subdermal 4-0 Vicryl and Steri-Strips.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.

Bunionectomy, SCARF type, with metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, left.,2.  Arthroplasty left second toe.,HISTORY:  ,This 39-year-old female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that she has had bunion for many months.  It has been progressively getting more painful at this time.  The patient attempted conservative treatment including wider shoe gear without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amount of Webril were placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo and digital block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinette was reflected.  The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  An incision was created over this area approximately 6 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was then dissected from the capsule.  Care was taken to preserve the neurovascular bundle.  Dorsal linear capsular incision was then created.  The capsule was then reflected from the head of the first metatarsal.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was performed until the abductor tendons were identified and transected.  A lateral capsulotomy was performed.  Attention was then directed back to the medial eminence where sagittal saw was used to resect the prominent medial eminence.  The incision was then extended proximally with further dissection down to the level of the bone.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted as access guides for the SCARF osteotomy.  A standard SCARF osteotomy was then performed.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally in order to reduce the first interspace in the metatarsal angle.  After adequate reduction of the bunion deformity was noted, the bone was temporarily fixated with a 0.45 K-wire.  A 3.0 x 12 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  A second 3.0 x 14 mm screw was also inserted with tight compression noted.  The remaining prominent medial eminence medially was then resected with a sagittal saw.  Reciprocating rasps were then used to smooth any sharp bony edges.  The temporary fixation wires were then removed.  The screws were again checked for tightness, which was noted.  Attention was directed to the medial capsule where a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed.  A straight stat was used to assist in removing a portion of the capsule.  The capsule was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl medially.  Dorsal capsule was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular stitch with #5-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress type fashion.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  A dorsal linear incision was then created over the proximal phalangeal joint of the left second toe.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade and the skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the capsule to be aligned laterally.  An incision was made on either side of the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  A curved mosquito stat was then used to reflex the tendon laterally.  The joint was identified and the medial collateral ligamentous attachments were resected off the head of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the head of the proximal head.  The bone was then rolled and the lateral collateral attachments were transected and the bone was removed in toto.  The extensor digitorum longus tendon was inspected and noted to be intact.  Any sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  Pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and an immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.

Rotator cuff debridement shaving glenoid and humeral head.,3.  Biceps tenotomy, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATION: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under interscalene block anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 61-year-old white male who is dominantly right-handed.  He had increasing right shoulder pain and dysfunction for a number of years prior to surgical intervention.  This was gradually done over a period of time.  No specific accident or injury could be seen or pointed.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  After discussing alternatives of the care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Preoperatively, the patient did not have limitation of motion.  He had gross weakness to his supraspinatus, mildly to the infraspinatus and subscapularis upon strength testing prior to his anesthetic.,Intraarticularly, the patient had an 80% biceps tendon tear that was dislocated.  His rotator interval was resolved as well as his subscapularis with tearing.  The supraspinatus was completely torn, retracted back beyond the level of the labrum and approximately one-third or so of the infraspinatus was involved with the remaining portion being greatly thinned as far as we could observe.  Glenoid labrum had degenerative tear in the inferior surface.  Gross chondromalacia was present to approximately 50% of the humeral head and approximately the upper 40% of the glenoid surface.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department, he was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created outside the end posteriorly and then anteriorly.  A full and complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out with the above-noted findings.  The shaver was placed anteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum tear and the last 20% of the biceps tendon tear was completed.  Debridement was carried out to the end or attachment of the bicep itself.,Debridement was carried out to what could be seen of the remaining rotator cuff there, but then the scope was redirected in a subacromial direction and gross bursectomy carried out.  Debridement was then carried out to the rotator cuff remaining tendon near the tuberosity.  No osteophytes were present.  Because of the massive nature of the tear, the CA ligament was maintained and there were no substantial changes to the subacromial region to necessitate burring.  There was concern because of instability that could be present at the end of this.,Another portal was created laterally to do all of this.  We did what we could to mobilize all sections of the rotator cuff, superiorly, posteriorly, and anteriorly.  We took this back to the level of coracoid base.  We released the coracohumeral ligament basically all but there was no excursion basically all to the portion of the rotator cuff torn.  Because of this, further debridement was carried out.  Debridement had been previously carried out to the humeral head as well as glenoid surface to debride the chondromalacia and take this down to the smooth edge.  Care was taken to not to debride deeper than that.  This was done prior to the above.,All instrumentation was removed.  A Pain-Buster catheter was placed into a separate anterolateral portal cut to length.  Interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closures.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, Elastoplast tape were placed for a compression dressing.,The patient's arm was placed in an arm sling.  He was transferred to his cart and to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute abdominal pain, rule out appendicitis versus other.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute pelvic inflammatory disease and periappendicitis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Diagnostic laparoscopy.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,CULTURES:,  Intra-abdominally are done.,HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 31-year-old African-American female patient who complains of sudden onset of pain and has seen in the Emergency Room.  The pain has started in the umbilical area and radiated to McBurney's point.  The patient appears to have a significant pain requiring surgical evaluation.  It did not appear that the pain was pelvic in nature, but more higher up in the abdomen, more towards the appendix.  The patient was seen by Dr. Y at my request in the ER with me in attendance.  We went over the case.  He decided that she should go to the operating room for evaluation and to have appendix evaluated and probably removed.  The patient on ultrasound had a 0.9 cm ovarian cyst on the right side.  The patient's cyst was not completely simple and they are concerns over the possibility of an abnormality.  The patient states that she has had chlamydia in the past, but it was not a pelvic infection more vaginal infection.  The patient has had hospitalization for this.  The patient therefore signed informed in layman's terms with her understanding that perceivable risks and complications, the alternative treatment, the procedure itself and recovery.  All questions were answered.  ,PROCEDURE: ,The patient was seen in the Emergency Room.  In the Emergency Room, there is really no apparent vaginal discharge.  No odor or cervical motion tenderness.  Negative bladder sweep.  Adnexa were without abnormalities.  In the OR, we were able to perform pelvic examination showing a slightly enlarged fibroid uterus about 9 to 10-week size.  The patient had no adnexal fullness.  The patient then underwent an insertion of a uterine manipulator and Dr. X was in the case at that time and he started the laparoscopic process i.e., inserting the laparoscope.  We then observed under direct laparoscopic visualization with the aid of a camera that there was pus in and around the uterus.  The both fallopian tubes were seen.  There did not appear to be hydrosalpinx.  The ovaries were seen.  The left showed some adhesions into the ovarian fossa.  The cul-de-sac had a banded adhesions.  The patient on the right adnexa had a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, where the cyst was only about a centimeter enlarged.  The ovary did not appear to have pus in it, but there was pus over the area of the bladder flap.  The patient's bowel was otherwise unremarkable.  The liver contained evidence of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and prior PID.  The appendix was somewhat adherent into the retrocecal area and to the mid-quadrant abdominal sidewall on the right.

She currently is trach dependent for her airway because of glottic and subglottic stenosis, but she is having no significant problems breathing and talking around her trach tube and came for further evaluation.  Endoscopic reevaluation of her tube and nature of the proposed procedure done.  Risk and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of with speech or swallowing, failure to improve her airway, and loss of voice.  Cardiorespiratory anesthetic results were discussed in length.  The patient states she understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient's #5 metal tracheostomy tube was removed and a #5 laser-safe endotracheal tube was inserted.  The patient was then prepared for endoscopy.  The Kantor laryngoscope was then inserted.  Oral cavity, hypopharynx, larynx, and nasal cavity showed good dentition with good tongue, buccal cavity, and mucosa without lesions.  Larynx was then ***** short epiglottis.  Larynx was suspended with significant scarring beginning in the supraglottic area with loss of laryngeal contour beginning in the supraglottis with extensive scar tissue at the level of the false cord obliteration of ventricles and true cords.  This appeared to be stable, and airway was patent at the supraglottic and glottic level with some narrowing at the subglottic level with mild-to-moderate subglottic stenosis, otherwise this appeared to be stable.  However, distally, the level of the trach site examined with the microscope and 0 and 30-degree telescopes.  The patient noted to have marked narrowing with dense scarring posterolaterally on the left securing good visualization of the trach tube.  The laryngoscope was removed, and a 5 x 30 pediatric rigid bronchoscope was then passed.  The LP contact tip laser was utilized to vaporize the scar tissue and release the scar banding following which the scope was passed and further dilation carried out.  Mid and distal trachea were widely patent.  Trachea and mainstem bronchi were patent without obvious disease.  The patient did not appear to have any relapsing polychondritis with progressive scar tissue at the level of the trach site and the posterior trachea wall was significant.  This was further dilated and following which was removed and a new #5 metal tracheostomy tube inserted.

4,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Hip pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the Pain Management Clinic, as well as from my residency training program, San Francisco. We have worked collaboratively for many years at the Pain Management Clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  She reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  In essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  She was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  With time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in San Francisco in her mid 30s by Dr. V, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at Hospital.  She was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  Most of this was focused on her SI joints.  At that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  This was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the Boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  She was seen at the Pain Center by Dr. R with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  She was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  Medications at that time were salicylate and Ultram.,When she returned to Portland in 1996, she was then working for Dr. B.  She was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  Subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  Orthotics were provided.  She was given Paxil and Tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  During this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  She has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  She currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  She is establishing care with Dr. S, of Rheumatology for her ongoing care.  Up until today, her pain medications were being written by Dr. Y prior to establishing with Dr. L.,Pain management in town had been first provided by the office of Dr. F. Under his care, followup MRIs were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  A number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with Flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  She then transferred her care to Ab Cd, FNP under the direction of Dr. K.  Her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  Because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,1.

Bladder calculus.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,INDICATIONS:,  This is a 62-year-old male diabetic and urinary retention with apparent neurogenic bladder and intermittent self-catheterization, recent urinary tract infections.  The cystoscopy showed a large bladder calculus, short but obstructing prostate.  He comes in now for transurethral resection of his prostate and holmium laser cystolithotripsy.,He is a diabetic with obesity.,LABORATORY DATA:  ,Includes urinalysis showing white cells too much to count, 3-5 red cells, occasional bacteria.  He had a serum creatinine of 1.2, sodium 138, potassium 4.6, glucose 190, calcium 9.1.  Hematocrit 40.5, hemoglobin 13.8, white count 7,900.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia.  Prepped and draped in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A 27-French Olympus rectoscope was passed via the urethra into the bladder.  The bladder, prostate, and urethra were inspected.  He had an obstructing prostate.  He had marked catheter reaction in his bladder.  He had a lot of villous changes, impossible to tell from frank tumor.  He had a huge bladder calculus.  It was white and round.,I used the holmium laser with the largest fiber through the continuous flow resectoscope and sheath, and broke up the stone, breaking up approximately 40 grams of stone.  There was still stone left at the end of the procedure.  Most of the chips that could be irrigated out of the bladder were irrigated out using Ellik.,Then the scope was removed and a 24-French 3-way Foley catheter was passed via the urethra into the bladder.,The plan is to probably discharge the patient in the morning and then we will get a KUB.  We will probably bring him back for a second stage cystolithotripsy, and ultimately do a TURP.  We broke up the stone for over an hour, and my judgment continuing with litholapaxy transurethrally over an hour begins to markedly increase the risk to the patient.urology, prostatism, holmium laser cystolithalopaxy, urinary tract infections, holmium laser, bladder calculus, bladder, cystolithalopaxy, diabetic, urethra, urinary, catheterization, stone, calculus, prostate,"

Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position.  Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel.,At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue.  Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis.  Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized.  At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated.  There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable.  There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted.  The articular surface could be visualized.  The biceps tendon was intact.  There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface.  The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well.  At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture.  It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure.  The capsule was also reflected posterior.  At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized.  It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact.  The humeral head was evaluated.  There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head.  At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head.  The arm was adequately positioned.  An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut.  This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck.  This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed.  At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized.  The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10.  Under direct visualization, this was performed easily.  At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins.  This was then removed.  A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured.  It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement.  At this point, the trial component was removed.  Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut.  The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization.  All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself.  This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point.  The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced.,The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion.  Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular.  The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity.  This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear.  This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire.  After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition.orthopedic, glenohumeral rotator cuff, arthroscopy, degenerative joint disease, shoulder hemiarthroplasty, rotator, cuff, subscapular, shoulder, "

The fracture healed uneventfully, but then the patient subsequently suffered a refracture one month ago.  The patient had shortening in arms, noted in both bones.  The parents opted for surgical stabilization with nailing.  This was performed one month ago on return visit.  His ulnar nail was quite prominent underneath the skin.  It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks.,Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risk of surgery incudes risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, need for longer casting.  All questions were answered and mother agreed to above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was seen in the operative room, placed supine on operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given Ancef preoperatively.  The left elbow was prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  A small incision was made over the palm with K-wire.  This was removed without incident.  The wound was irrigated.  The bursitis was curetted.  Wounds closed using #4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Xeroform 4 x 4s and Webril.  Please note the area infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine.  The patient was then placed in a long-arm cast.

Upon evaluation, it was noted that the patient has draining bilateral masses with the left mass being approximately 8 cm in diameter upon palpation and the right being approximately 4 cm in diameter.  The patient had been continued on antibiotics preoperatively.  The patient with history of Hodgkin's lymphoma approximately 18 years ago and underwent therapy at that time and he was declared free of disease since that time.  Consent for possible recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma warranted exploration and excision of these masses.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits of the procedure and informed consent was obtained.,GROSS FINDINGS: , Upon dissection of the left axillary mass, the mass was removed in toto and noted to have a cavity within it consistent with an abscess.,No loose structures were identified and sent for frozen section, which upon intraoperative consultation with Pathology Department revealed no obvious evidence of lymphoma, however, the confirmed pathology report is pending at this time.  The right axillary mass was excised without difficulty without requiring full axillary dissection.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in supine position after appropriate anesthesia was obtained and a sterile prep and drape complete.  A #10 blade scalpel was used to make an elliptical incision about the mass itself extending this incision further to aid in the mobilization of the mass.  Sharp dissection was utilized with Metzenbaum scissors about the mass to maintain the injury to the skin structure and upon showing out the mass, Bovie electrocautery was utilized adjacent to the wall structure to maintain hemostasis.  Identification of the axillary anatomy was made and care was made to avoid injury to nerve, vessel or musculature.  Once this mass was removed in toto, lymph node structures were as well delivered with this mass and sent to frozen section as well the specimen was sent to gram stain and culture.  Upon revaluation of the incisional site, it was noted to be hemostatic.  Warm lap sponge was then left in place at this site.  Next, attention was turned to the right axilla where a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a 4 cm incision about the mass including the cutaneous structures involved with the erythematous reaction.  This was as well removed in toto and sent to Pathology for gram stain and culture as well as pathologic evaluation.  This site was then made hemostatic as well with the aid of Bovie electrocautery and approximation of the deep dermal tissues after irrigation with warm saline was then done with #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by #4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Attention was returned back left axilla, which upon re-exploration was noted to be hemostatic and a #7 mm JP was then introduced making a skin stab inferior to the incision and bringing the end of the drain through this incision.  This was placed within the incision site, ________ drainage of the axillary potential space.  Approximation of the deep dermal tissues were then done with #3-0 Vicryl in an interrupted technique followed by #4-0 Vicryl with running subcuticular technique.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  JP bulb was then placed to suction and sterile dressings were applied to both axilla.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a stable condition.  He will be discharged to home upon ability of the patient to have pain tolerance with Vicodin 1-2 as needed every six hours for pain and continue on Keflex antibiotics until gram stain culture proves otherwise.hematology - oncology, incision and drainage, axillary mass excision, axillary dissection, hodgkin's disease, axillary mass, mass, incision, axillary,"

The general anesthesia was achieved with intubation with no problems.  Both eyes were prepped and draped in usual manner.  The attention was turned the right eye and a hole was made in the drape and a self-retaining eye speculum was placed ensuring eyelash in the eye drape.  The microscope was focused on the palpebral limbus and the eyeball was rotated medially and laterally with no problem.  The eyeball rotated medially and upwards by holding the limbus at 7 o'clock position.  Inferior fornix conjunctival incision was made and Tenons capsule buttonholed.  The lateral rectus muscle was engaged over the muscle hook and the Tenons capsule was retracted with the tip of the muscle hook.  The Tenons capsule was buttonholed.  The tip of the muscle hook and Tenons capsule was cleaned from the insertion of the muscle.  __________ extension of the muscle was excised.  The 7-0 Vicryl sutures were placed at the insertion of the muscle and double locked at the upper and lower borders.  The muscle was disinserted from original insertion.  The suture was passed 8 mm posterior to the insertion of the muscle in double sewed fashion.  The suture was pulled, tied, and cut.  The muscle was in good position.  The conjunctiva was closed with 7-0 Vicryl suture in running fashion.  The suture was pulled, tied, and cut.

Topical tetracaine drops were applied.  The operative eye was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was inserted.,Under the Zeiss operating microscope, a lateral clear corneal approach was utilized.  A stab incision was made with a diamond blade to the right of the lateral limbus and the anterior chamber filled with intracameral lidocaine and viscoelastic.  A 3-mm single pass clear corneal incision was made just anterior to the vascular arcade of the temporal limbus using a diamond keratome.  A 5- to 5.5-mm anterior capsulorrhexis was created.  The nucleus was hydrodissected and hydrodelineated, and was freely movable in the capsular bag.  The nucleus was then phacoemulsified using a quadrantic divide-and-conquer technique.  Following the deep groove formation, the lens was split bimanually and the resultant quadrants and epicortex removed under high-vacuum burst-mode phacoemulsification.  Peripheral cortex was removed with the irrigation and aspiration handpiece.  The posterior capsule was polished.  The capsular bag was expanded with viscoelastic.  The implant was inspected under the microscope and found to be free of defects.  The implant was inserted into the cartridge system under viscoelastic and placed in the capsular bag.  The trailing haptic was positioned with the cartridge system.  Residual viscoelastic was removed from the anterior chamber and from behind the implant.  The corneal wound was hydrated with balanced salt solution.  The anterior chamber was fully re-formed through the side-port incision.  The wound was inspected and found to be watertight.  The intraocular pressure was adjusted as necessary.  The lid speculum was removed.  Topical Timoptic drops, Eserine and Dexacidin ointment were applied.  The eye was shielded.

The patient was in early stage of gestation.  Benefits and risks including radiation exposure were discussed with the patient and consulted her primary care doctor.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Supine position, LMA anesthesia, well-padded arm, tourniquet, Hibiclens, alcohol prep, and sterile drape.,Exsanguination achieved, tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.  First, under fluoroscopy the fracture was reduced.  A 0.045 K-wire was inserted from dorsal ulnar corner of the distal radius and crossing fracture line to maintain the reduction.  A 2-cm radial incision, superficial radial nerve was exposed and protected.  Dissecting between the first and second dorsal extensor retinaculum, the second dorsal extensor compartment was elevated off from the distal radius.  The guidewire was inserted under fluoroscopy.  A cannulated drill was used to drill antral hole.  Antral awl was inserted.  Then we reamed the canal to size 2.  Size 2 Micronail was inserted to the medullary canal.  Using distal locking guide, three locking screws were inserted distally.  The second dorsal incision was made.  The deep radial dorsal surface was exposed.  Using locking guide, two proximal shaft screws were inserted and locked the nail to the radius.  Fluoroscopic imaging was taken and showing restoration of the height, tilt, and inclination of the radius.  At this point, tourniquet was deflated, hemostasis achieved, wounds irrigated and closed in layers.  Sterile dressing applied.

4,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the ""early stages of a likely dementia"" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began ""as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was ""too derogatory.""  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated ""diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.""  It concluded that ""results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy…  The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot ""like dragging.""  Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.  She drinks two to four cups of coffee per day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient was born and raised in North Carolina.  She was the sixth of nine siblings.  Her father was a chef.  He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  Her mother is 93 years old.  Her last job was as a janitor.  She completed fourth grade.  She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  She was married for two years.  Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  She has two children ages 43 and 30.  Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.  She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable.  When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things.  She denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.,TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II), Token Test, Sentence Repetition, Visual Naming, Controlled Oral Word Association, Spelling Test, Aural Comprehension, Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Testnan"
2,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Nausea.,PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 28-year-old, who is status post gastric bypass surgery nearly one year ago.  He has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back.  He feels like he was on it but has not done so.  He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3.  He denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms.

1,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Cervical spondylosis at C3-C4 with cervical radiculopathy and spinal cord compression.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Cervical spondylosis at C3-C4 with cervical radiculopathy and spinal cord compression.,OPERATION PERFORMED,1.  Anterior cervical discectomy of C3-C4.,2.  Removal of herniated disc and osteophytes.,3.  Bilateral C4 nerve root decompression.,4.  Harvesting of bone for autologous vertebral bodies for creation of arthrodesis.,5.  Grafting of fibular allograft bone for creation of arthrodesis.,6.  Creation of arthrodesis via an anterior technique with fibular allograft bone and autologous bone from the vertebral bodies.,7.  Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man has progressive and intractable right C4 radiculopathy with neck and shoulder pain.  Conservative therapy has failed to improve the problem.  Imaging studies showed severe spondylosis of C3-C4 with neuroforaminal narrowing and spinal cord compression.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the nature of the procedure including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understood it and had no further questions and requested that I proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated using a fiberoptic technique.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion doses.  The neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made on a skin crease on the left side of the neck.  Dissection was carried down through the platysmal musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscles were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  A needle was placed and it was believed to be at the C3-C4 interspace and an x-ray properly localized this space.  Castoff self-retaining pins were placed into the body of the C3 and C4.  Self-retaining retractors were placed in the wound keeping the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,The annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed.  Quite a bit of overhanging osteophytes were identified and removed.  As I worked back to the posterior lips of the vertebral body, the operating microscope was utilized.,There was severe overgrowth of spondylitic spurs.  A high-speed diamond bur was used to slowly drill these spurs away.  I reached the posterior longitudinal ligament and opened it and exposed the underlying dura.,Slowly and carefully I worked out towards the C3-C4 foramen.  The dura was extremely thin and I could see through it in several areas.  I removed the bony compression in the foramen and identified soft tissue and veins overlying the root.  All of these were not stripped away for fear of tearing this very tissue-paper-thin dura.  However, radical decompression was achieved removing all the bony compression in the foramen, out to the pedicle, and into the foramen.  An 8-mm of the root was exposed although I left the veins over the root intact.,The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar procedure was performed.,Once the decompression was achieved, a high-speed cortisone bur was used to decorticate the body from the greater posterior shelf to prevent backward graft migration.  Bone thus from the drilling was preserved for use for the arthrodesis.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  As I had drilled quite a bit into the bodies, I selected a large 12-mm graft and distracted the space maximally.  Under distraction the graft was placed and fit well.  An x-ray showed good graft placement.,Attention was turned to spinal instrumentation.  A Synthes Short Stature plate was used with four 3-mm screws.  Holes were drilled with all four screws were placed with pretty good purchase.  Next, the locking screws were then applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of graft, plate, and screws.  The upper screws were near the upper endplate of C3.  The C3 vertebral body that remained was narrow after drilling off the spurs.  Rather than replace these screws and risk that the next holes would be too near the present holes I decided to leave these screws intact because their position is still satisfactory as they are below the disc endplate.,Attention was turned to closure.  A Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab wound incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied along with a rigid Philadelphia collar.  The operation was then terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisted of bone and soft tissue as well as C3-C4 disc material.surgery, herniated, osteophytes, nerve root decompression, harvesting, autologous, vertebral, arthrodesis, anterior technique, anterior cervical discectomy, spinal cord compression, fibular allograft bone, creation of arthrodesis, cervical discectomy, spinal instrumentation, cord compression, vertebral body, vertebral bodies, spinal cord, bone, instrumentation, cervical, anterior, grafting, spinal, discectomy, allograft, "
4,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 53-year-old widowed woman, she lives at ABC Hotel.  She presented with a complaint of chest pain, evaluations revealed severe aortic stenosis.  She has been refusing cardiac catheter and she may well need aortic valve replacement.  She states that she does not want heart surgery or valve replacement.  She has a history of bipolar disorder and has been diagnosed at times with schizophrenia.  She is on Depakote 500 mg three times a day and Geodon 80 mg twice a day.  The patient receives mental health care through the XYZ Health System and there is a psychiatrist who makes rounds at the ABC Hotel.  She denies hallucinations, psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation at this time.  States that she does not want surgery because the chest pain that was a presenting complaint has gone away that she did not feel her problem is severe enough to require surgery, and medical records does show in this obese individual that cardiac surgery would present substantial risks and for this individual with the chronic mental illness and behavioral problems of a chronic nature, surgery does present some additional risks.  The patient notes that she has a long history of substance abuse, primarily inhalation of paint vapors that she had more than 100 incarcerations in the XYZ County Jail related to offenses related to her lifestyle at that time such as shoplifting, violation of orders to abstain from substance abuse and the longest confinement of these was 100 days.,The patient is able to write a fairly reasonable explanation for why she does not want to pursue medical care.,PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , She was born in XYZ.  She is a high-school graduate from ABCD High School.  She did have an abusive childhood.  She is married four times.  She notes she developed depression when a number of her children died.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL: , This is an obese woman in bed.  She is somewhat restless and moving during the interview.,VITAL SIGNS,:  Temperature of 97.3, pulse 70, respirations 18, blood pressure 113/68, and oxygen saturation 94% on 3 L of oxygen.,PSYCHIATRY:  ,Speech is normal, rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary consistent with her educational level.  There is no overt thought disorder.  She does not appear psychotic.  She is not suicidal on formal testing.  She gives the date as Sunday, 05/19/2007 when it is the 20th and 207 when it is 2007.  She is oriented to place.  She can memorize four times, repeats two at five minutes, gets the other two with category hints, this places short-term memory in normal limits.  She had difficulty with serial three subtractions, counting on her fingers and had difficulty naming the months in reverse order stating, ""December, November, September, October, June, July, August, September,"" but recognizes this was not right and then said, ""March, April, May.""  She is able to name objects appropriately.,LABORATORY DATA: , Chest x-ray showing no acute changes.  Carotid duplex shows no stenosis.  Electrolytes and liver function tests are normal.  TSH normal.  Hematocrit 31%.  Triglycerides 152.,DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Bipolar disorder, apparently stable on medications.,2.  Mild organic brain syndrome, presumably secondary to her chronic inhalant, paint, abuse.,3.  Aortic stenosis.,4.  Sleep apnea.,5.  Obesity.,6.  Anemia.,7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  It is my impression at present that the patient retains ability to make decisions on her own behalf.  Given this lady's underlying mental problems, I would recommend that her treating physicians discuss her circumstances with physicians who round on her at the ABC Hotel.  While she may well need surgery and cardiac catheter, she may be more willing to accept this in the context of some continued encouragement from care providers who usually provide care for her.  She clearly at this time wants to leave this hospital; she normally gets her care through XYZ Health.  Again, in summary, I would consider her to retain the ability to make decisions on her own behalf.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.psychiatry / psychology, organic brain syndrom, substance abuse, bipolar disorder, mental, abuse, "
2,"HISTORY: , The patient is scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass.  The patient has been earlier seen by Dr. X, her physician.  She has been referred to us from Family Practice.  In short, she is a 33-year-old lady with a BMI of 43, otherwise healthy with unsuccessful nonsurgical methods of weight loss. ,She was on laparoscopic gastric bypass for weight loss. ,She meets the National Institute of Health Criteria.  She is very well educated and motivated and has no major medical contraindications for the procedure.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On physical examination today, she weighs 216 pounds with a BMI of 43.5, pulse is 96, temperature is 97.6, blood pressure is 122/80.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  There is stigmata for morbid obesity.  She has cesarean section scars in the lower abdomen with no herniation. ,DISCUSSION: , I had a long talk with the patient about laparoscopic gastric bypass, possible open including risks, benefits, alternatives, need for long-term followup, need to adhere to dietary and exercise guidelines.  I also explained to her complications including rare cases of death secondary to DVT, PE, leak , peritonitis, sepsis, shock, multisystem organ failure, need for re-operation including for leak or bleeding, gastrostomy or jejunostomy for feeding, rare case of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, etc., with myocardial infarction, pneumonia, atelectasis in the postoperative period were also discussed. ,Short-term complications of gastric bypass including gastrojejunal stricture requiring endoscopic dilatation, marginal ulcer secondary to smoking or anti-inflammatory drug intake which can progress on to perforation or bleeding, small bowel obstruction secondary to internal hernia or adhesions, signs and symptoms of which were discussed.  The patient would alert us for earlier intervention.  Symptomatic gallstone formation secondary to rapid weight loss were also discussed.  How to avoid it by taking ursodiol were also discussed.  Long-term complications of gastric bypass including hair loss, excess skin, multivitamin and mineral deficiencies, protein-calorie malnutrition, weight regain, weight plateauing, need for major lifestyle and exercise and habit changes, avoiding pregnancy in the first two years, etc., were all stressed.  The patient understands.  She wants to go to surgery. ,In preparation of surgery, she will undergo very low-calorie diet through Medifast to decrease the size of the liver to make laparoscopic approach more successful and also to optimize her cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities.  She will also see a psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist for a multidisciplinary effort for short and long-term success for weight loss surgery.  I will see her two weeks before the plan of surgery for further discussion and any other questions at that point of time.consult - history and phy., medifast, laparoscopic gastric bypass, short-term complications, long-term complications, gastric bypass, complications of gastric bypass, weight loss, "

I reviewed the localizing films with the radiologist, and the patient was then brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,The skin overlying the needle tip was incised in a curvilinear fashion.  Dissection down to the needle tip was performed using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  Every attempt was made to get approximately 1 cm of normal tissue around the lesion.  The wire was released and the lesion having been excised was removed from the wound and sent to Radiology for confirmation of excision.  The wound was copiously irrigated with sterile water, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery.  Once Radiology called and confirmed complete excision of the mass, the skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin and Steri-Strips were applied.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.surgery, curvilinear fashion, bovie electrocautery, breast biopsy, needle localization, needle tip, curvilinear, breast, biopsy, needle"

The working diagnosis is lymphoma, however, the Hematology and Oncology Departments were requesting a lymph node biopsy in order to confirm the diagnosis as well as prognosis.  Thus, the patient was scheduled for a lymph node biopsy with platelets running secondary to thrombocytopenia at the time of surgery.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a large right axillary lymphadenopathy, one of the lymph node was sent down as a fresh specimen.,PROCEDURE:  ,After informed written consent, risks and benefits of this procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.  Multiple lymph nodes were palpated in the right axilla, however, the most inferior node was to be removed.  First, the skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine solution.  Next, using a #15 blade scalpel, an incision was made approximately 4 cm in length transversally in the inferior axilla.  Next, using electro Bovie cautery, maintaining hemostasis, dissection was carried down to the lymph node.  The lymph node was then completely excised using electro Bovie cautery as well as hemostats to maintain hemostasis and then lymph node was sent to specimen fresh to the lab.  Several hemostats were used, suture ligated with #3-0 Vicryl suture and hemostasis was maintained.  Next the deep dermal layers were approximated with #3-0 Vicryl suture.

1,"FINAL DIAGNOSES:,  Delivered pregnancy, cholestasis of pregnancy, fetal intolerance to labor, failure to progress.,PROCEDURE: , Included primary low transverse cesarean section.,SUMMARY: , This 32-year-old gravida 2 was induced for cholestasis of pregnancy at 38-1/2 weeks.  The patient underwent a 2-day induction.  On the second day, the patient continued to progress all the way to the point of 9.5 cm at which point, she failed to progress.  During the hour or two of evaluation at 9.5 cm, the patient was also noted to have some fetal tachycardia and an occasional late deceleration.  Secondary to these factors, the patient was brought to the operative suite for primary low transverse cesarean section, which she underwent without significant complication.  There was a slightly enlarged blood loss at approximately 1200 mL, and postoperatively, the patient was noted to have a very mild tachycardia coupled with 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit temperature right at delivery.  It was felt that this was a sign of very early chorioamnionitis and therapeutic antibiotics were given throughout her stay.  The patient received 72 hours of antibiotics with there never being a temperature above 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  The maternal tachycardia resolved within a day.  The patient did well throughout the 3-day stay progressing to full diet, regular bowel movements, normal urination patterns.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells on Sunday when attended to by my partner secondary to a hematocrit of 20%.

Since then, the patient started complaining of acute right arm and right leg weakness, which had been progressively worsening.  About two days ago, he started noticing weakness on the left arm.  The patient also noted shuffling gait.  The patient presented to a family physician and was referred to Dr. X for further evaluation.  Dr. X could not attempt to this, so he called me at the office and the patient was sent to the emergency room, where an MRI of the brain was essentially unremarkable as well as MRI of the thoracic spine.  MRI of the cervical spine, however, revealed an acute disk herniation at C3-C4 with evidence of stenosis and cord changes.  Based on these findings, I recommended decompression.  The patient was started on Decadron at 10 mg IV q.6h.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him.  Risks to include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Bleeding can be superficial, but can compromise airway, for which he has been told that he may be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  The hematoma could also be an epidural hematoma, which may compress the spinal cord and result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function.  Should this happen, he needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the risk by removing the hematoma that he can deteriorate as far as neurological condition, but this hopefully with the steroid prep will be prevented or if present will only be transient.  There is also the possibility of infection, which can be superficial and treated with IV and p.o. antibiotics.  However, should the infection be extensive or be deep, he may require return to the operating room for debridement and irrigation.  This may pose a medical problem since in the presence of infection, the graft as well as spinal instrumentation may have to be removed.  There is also the possibility of dural tear with its attendant complaints of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, as well as the development of pseudomeningocele.  This too can compromise airway and may require return to the operating room for repair of the dural tear.  There is also potential risk of injury to the esophagus, the trachea, as well as the carotid.  The patient can also have a stroke on the right cerebral circulation should the plaque be propelled into the right circulation.  The patient understood all these risks together with the risk associated with anesthesia and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  No monitoring leads were placed.  The patient was then positioned supine on the operating table with the head supported on a foam doughnut and the neck placed on hyperextension with a shoulder roll under both shoulders.  Localizing x-ray verified the marker to be right at the C3-4 interspace.  Proceeded to mark an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid with the central point at the area of the marker measuring about 3 cm in length.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to cut the platysma in a similar fashion.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried superior to and lateral to the esophagus and trachea, but medial to the carotid sheath.  The prevertebral fascia was identified.  Localizing x-ray verified another marker to be at the C3-4 interspace.  Proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C3 and C4 and a self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  There was some degree of anterior osteophyte and this was carefully drilled down with a Midas 5-mm bur.  The disk was then cut through the annulus and removal of the disk was done with the use of the Midas 5-mm bur and later a 3-mm bur.  The inferior endplate of C3 and the superior endplate of C4 were likewise drilled out together with posterior inferior osteophyte at the C3 and the posterior superior osteophyte at C4.  There was note of a central disk herniation centrally, but more marked displacement of the cord on the left side.  By careful dissection of this disk, posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and pressure on the cord was removed.  Hemostasis of the epidural bleeders was done with a combination of bipolar coagulation, but we needed to put a small piece of Gelfoam on the patient's left because of profuse venous bleeder.  With this completed, the Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  A 7-mm implant with its interior packed with Vitoss was then tapped into place.  An 18-mm plate was then screwed down with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws.  The area was irrigated with saline, with bacitracin solution.  Postoperative x-ray showed excellent placement of the graft and spinal instrumentation.  A round French 10 JP drain was laid over the construct and exteriorized though a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis and Dermabond.  The catheter was anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch.  Dressing was placed only on the exit site of the drain.  C-collar was placed, and the patient was transferred to the recovery awake and moving all four extremities.nan"

General anesthesia was accomplished.  A 16-French Foley was placed using aseptic technique.  The patient was then placed on the operating table prone.  His right flank was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  At this point, contrast was injected through his existing nephrostomy tube and there was no continuity with the collecting system and it was removed.  The 5-French Pollack catheter was used to pass a 0.38 super-stiff Amplatz wire.  The wire would not go down the ureter.  Multiple attempts were made using Pollack catheters and Cobra catheters and attempts were made to dilate the track, both with rigid dilator and the balloon dilator and access could not be obtained.  After multiple attempts, access was lost.  At this point, the tubes were left out of the kidney and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient was then placed on another operating table supine.  His genitalia were prepped and draped after removing his Foley catheter.  Flexible cystoscopy was performed and the right orifice identified, which was edematous and erythematous.  The wire was passed up to kidney and a 5-French Pollack catheter was then passed over to after the removing the scope.  The wire was removed.  Contrast injection with good placement in the collecting system.  The wire was replaced.  The Pollack catheter removed and 6-French variable length double-J stent was inserted using fluoroscopic guidance.  The wire was removed leaving the double-J stent in good position.  _______ 16-French Foley was reinserted and connected to close drains.,Procedure was terminated at this point and had been well tolerated.

She had no prior history of skin cancer.  She is status post bilateral cosmetic breast augmentation many years ago and the records are not available for this procedure.  She has noted progressive hardening and distortion of the implant.  She desires to have the implants removed, capsulectomy and replacement of implants.  She would like to go slightly smaller than her current size as she has ptosis going with a smaller implant combined with capsulectomy will result in worsening of her ptosis.  She may require a lift.  She is not consenting to lift due to the surgical scars.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY,Significant for deep venous thrombosis and acid reflux.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY,Significant for appendectomy, colonoscopy and BAM.,MEDICATIONS,1.

No lesions are noted in the regional lymph node base and no mass is appreciated.,BREAST:  Examination of the breast demonstrates bilateral grade IV capsular contracture.  She has asymmetry in distortion of the breast.  No masses are appreciated in the breast or the axilla.  The implants appear to be subglandular.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.,EXTREMITIES:  Show full range of motion.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,SKIN:  Significant environmental actinic skin damage.,I recommended excision of basal cell cancers with frozen section control of the margin, closure will require local tissue flaps.  I recommended exchange of the implants with reaugmentation.  No final size is guaranteed or implied.  We will decrease the size of the implants based on the intraoperative findings as the size is not known.  Several options are available.  Sizer implants will be placed to best estimate postoperative size.  Ptosis will be worse following capsulectomy and going with a smaller implant.  She may require a lift in the future.  We have obtained preoperative clearance from the patient's cardiologist, Dr. K.  The patient has been taken off Coumadin for five days and will be placed back on Coumadin the day after the surgery.  The risk of deep venous thrombosis is discussed.  Other risk including bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, pain, scarring, hypertrophic scarring and poor cosmetic resolve, worsening of ptosis, exposure, extrusion, the rupture of the implants, numbness of the nipple-areolar complex, hematoma, need for additional surgery, recurrent capsular contracture and recurrence of the skin cancer was all discussed, which she understands and informed consent is obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,After appropriate informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the preoperative holding area with **** input.  She was then taken to the major operating room with ABCD Surgery Center, placed in a supine position.  Intravenous antibiotics were given.  TED hose and SCDs were placed.  After the induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Sites for excision and skin cancers were carefully marked with 5 mm margin.  These were injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.,After allowing adequate time for basal constriction hemostasis, excision was performed, full thickness of the skin.  They were tagged at the 12 o'clock position and sent for frozen section.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Once margins were determined to be free of involvement, local tissue flaps were designed for advancement.  Undermining was performed.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Closure was performed under moderate tension with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed under loop magnification paying meticulous attention and cosmetic details with 6-0 Prolene.  Attention was then turned to the breast, clothes were changed, gloves were changed, incision was planned and the previous inframammary incision beginning on the right incision was made.  Dissection was carried down to the capsule.  It was extremely calcified.  Dissection of the anterior surface of the capsule was performed.  The implant was subglandular, the capsule was entered, implant was noted to be grossly intact; however, there was free silicone.  Implant was removed and noted to be ruptured.  No marking as to the size of the implant was found.,Capsulectomy was performed leaving a small portion in the axilla in the inframammary fold.  Pocket was modified to medialize the implant by placing 2-0 Prolene laterally in mattress sutures to restrict the pocket.  In identical fashion, capsulectomy was performed on the left.  Implant was noted to be grossly ruptured.  No marking was found for the size of the implant.  The entire content was weighed and found to be 350 grams.  Right side was weighed and noted to be 338 grams, although some silicone was lost in the transfer and most likely was identical 350 grams.  The implants appeared to be double lumen with the saline portion deflated.  Completion of the capsulectomy was performed on the left.nan"

4,"HISTORY: , Neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with her seizure medication.  The patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy.  She had been previously followed by XYZ, but has been under the care of the UCSF epilepsy program and recently by Dr. Y.  I reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at CHCC and also interviewed mom.,The patient had seizure breakthrough in August 2007, which requires inpatient admission, Thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early December.  She remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with Diastat.  She presented to our ER today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of Diastat at home.  Mom documented 103 temperature at home.  In the ER, this was 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.  I reviewed the ER notes.  At 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5.  UCSF fellow was contacted.  She was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered.  Vital weight was 27.  Seizures apparently had stopped.  The valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79.  According to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose.  Other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal CMP.,Previous workup here showed an EEG on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus.  MRI on June 2007 and January 2005 were within normal limits.  Mom describes the following seizure types:,1.  Eye blinking with unresponsiveness.,2.  Staring off to one side.,3.  Focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure.,She also said that she was supposed to see Dr. Y this Friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available.  She was being to physicians' care as Dr. Z had previously being following her last UCSF.,She had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs.  These include Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  These are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these.  Actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension.,She also had been treated with Clobazam.  Her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and Tranxene.  Other attempts to taper Topamax, but this resulted increased seizures.  She also has oligohidrosis during this summertime.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Include Diastat 20 mg; Topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; Tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; Depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 15 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.,NECK:  Supple.,NEUROLOGICAL:  She had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed.,She was able to follow commands such as when I request that she gave mom a kiss.  She acknowledged her doll.  Left fundus is sharp.  She resisted the rest of the exam.  There was no obvious lateralized findings.,ASSESSMENT:,  Status epilepticus resolved.  Triggered by a febrile illness, possibly viral.  Refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy.,IMPRESSION: , I discussed the maximizing Depakote to mom and she concurred.  I recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning, one in the day, and two at bedtime.  For today, she did give an IV Depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued IV until she is taking p.o.  Dr. X agreed with the changes and orders were written for this.  She can continue her current doses of Topamax and Tranxene.  This can be given by NG if needed.  Topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.  I will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization.  Mom will call contact Dr. Y an update him about the recent changes.neurology, eye blinking, status epilepticus, seizure medication, valproic acid, allergic reactions, neurologic consultation, seizure, neurologic, seizures,"

ENT was asked to see the patient regarding postop dysphagia with findings at that time of the consultation on 08/17/03 with a fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy, a right parapharyngeal hemorrhagic lesion possibly secondary to LMA intubation.  The patient subsequently resolved with his dysphagia and workup of Speech was obtained, which showed no aspiration, no pooling, minimal premature spillage with solids, but good protection of the airway.  This is a reevaluation of the right parapharyngeal hemorrhagic lesion that was noted prior.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: ,The patient was brought in the semi-Fowler's position, a fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was then passed into the patient's right nasal passage, all the way to the nasopharynx.  The scope was then flexed caudally and advanced slowly through the nasopharynx into the oropharynx, and down to the hypopharynx.  The patient's oro and nasopharynx all appeared normal with no signs of any gross lesions, edema, or ecchymosis.,Within the hypopharynx although there was an area of fullness and on the right side around the level of the thyroid cartilage cornu that seemed to be prominent and within the lumen of the hypopharynx.  There were no signs of any obstruction.  The epiglottis, piriform sinuses, vallecula, and base of tongue all appeared normal with no signs of any gross lesions.  The patient with excellent phonation with good glottic closure upon phonation and no signs of any aspiration or pooling of secretions.  The scope was then pulled out and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  At this time, we will follow up as an outpatient and possibly there is a need for a microscopic suspension direct laryngoscopy for evaluation of this right parapharyngeal lesion.ent - otolaryngology, parapharyngeal, dysphagia, sinus pooling, piriform, nasolaryngoscopy, fiberoptic, laryngoscope, nasopharynx, oropharynx, fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy, hemorrhagic lesion, aspiration, cartilage, hypopharynx, lesion,"

He has elected to undergo radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Deep venous thrombosis.,6.  Recurrence of the cancer.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area.  Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered.  The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed.  The rectus fascia was opened sharply.  The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly.  Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed.  The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched.  The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder.  Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips.  The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section.  The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors.  The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply.  The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area.  The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle.  The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra was then identified and was dissected out.  The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly.  2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later.  The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected.  The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides.  The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply.  No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time.  The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily.  Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely.  The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected.  The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles.  Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen.  The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact.  It was sent for permanent section.  The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels.  The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck.  Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck.  A 20-French Foley Catheter was used.  The anterior sutures were then placed.  The Foley was then inflated.  The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly.  Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight.  Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces.  These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed.

2,"DATE OF INJURY : October 4, 2000,DATE OF EXAMINATION : September 5, 2003,EXAMINING PHYSICIAN : X Y, MD,Prior to the beginning of the examination, it is explained to the examinee that this examination is intended for evaluative purposes only, and that it is not intended to constitute a general medical examination. It is explained to the examinee that the traditional doctor-patient relationship does not apply to this examination, and that a written report will be provided to the agency requesting this examination. It has also been emphasized to the examinee that he should not attempt any physical activity beyond his tolerance, in order to avoid injury.,CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Aching and mid back pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT INJURY: , Based upon the examinee's perspective: ,Mr. Abc is a 52-year-old self-employed, independent consultant for DEMILEE-USA. He is also a mechanical engineer. He reports that he was injured in a motor vehicle accident that occurred in October 4, 2000. At that time, he was employed as a purchasing agent for IBIKEN-USA. On the date of the motor vehicle accident, he was sitting in the right front passenger's seat, wearing seat and shoulder belt safety harnesses, in his 1996 or 1997 Volvo 850 Wagon automobile driven by his son. The vehicle was completely stopped and was ""slammed from behind"" by a van. The police officer, who responded to the accident, told Mr. Abc that the van was probably traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour at the time of impact.,During the impact, Mr. Abc was restrained in the seat and did not contact the interior surface of the vehicle. He experienced immediate mid back pain. He states that the Volvo automobile sustained approximately $4600 in damage.,He was transported by an ambulance, secured by a cervical collar and backboard to the emergency department. An x-ray of the whole spine was obtained, and he was evaluated by a physician's assistant. He was told that it would be ""okay to walk."" He was prescribed pain pills and told to return for reevaluation if he experienced increasing pain.,He returned to the Kaiser facility a few days later, and physical therapy was prescribed. Mr. Abc states that he was told that ""these things can take a long time."" He indicates that after one year he was no better. He then states that after two years he was no better and worried if the condition would never get better.,He indicates he saw an independent physician, a general practitioner, and an MRI was ordered. The MRI study was completed at ABCD Hospital. Subsequently, Mr. Abc returned and was evaluated by a physiatrist. The physiatrist reexamined the original thoracic spine x-rays that were taken on October 4, 2000, and stated that he did not know why the radiologist did not originally observe vertebral compression fractures. Mr. Abc believes that he was told by the physiatrist that it involved either T6-T7 or T7-T8.,Mr. Abc reports that the physiatrist told him that little could be done besides participation in core strengthening. Mr. Abc describes his current exercise regimen, consisting of cycling, and it was deemed to be adequate. He was told, however, by the physiatrist that he could also try a Pilates type of core exercise program.,The physiatrist ordered a bone scan, and Mr. Abc is unsure of the results. He does not have a formal follow up scheduled with Kaiser, and is awaiting re-contact by the physiatrist.,He denies any previous history of symptomatology or injuries involving his back.,CURRENT SYMPTOMS:  ,He reports that he has the same mid back pain that has been present since the original injury. It is located in the same area, the mid thoracic spine area. It is described as a pain and an ache and ranges from 3/10 to 6/10 in intensity, and the intensity varies, seeming to go in cycles. The pain has been staying constant.,When I asked whether or not the pain have improved, he stated that he was unable to determine whether or not he had experienced improvement. He indicates that there may be less pain, or conversely, that he may have developed more of a tolerance for the pain. He further states that ""I can power through it."" ""I have learned how to manage the pain, using exercise, stretching, and diversion techniques."" It is primary limitation with regards to the back pain involves prolonged sitting. After approximately two hours of sitting, he has required to get up and move around, which results in diminishment of the pain. He indicates that prior to the motor vehicle accident, he could sit for significantly longer periods of time, 10 to 12 hours on a regular basis, and up to 20 hours, continuously, on an occasional basis.,He has never experienced radiation of the pain from the mid thoracic spine, and he has never experienced radicular symptoms of radiation of pain into the extremities, numbness, tingling, or weakness.,Again, aggravating activities include prolonged sitting, greater than approximately two hours.,Alleviating activities include moving around, stretching, and exercising. Also, if he takes ibuprofen, it does seem to help with the back pain.,He is not currently taking medications regularly, but list that he takes occasional ibuprofen when the pain is too persistent.,He indicates that he received several physical therapy sessions for treatment, and was instructed in stretching and exercises. He has subsequently performed the prescribed stretching and exercises daily, for nearly three years.,With regards to recreational activities, he states that he has not limited his activities due to his back pain.,He denies bowel or bladder dysfunction.,FILES REVIEW:  ,October 4, 2000: An ambulance was dispatched to the scene of a motor vehicle accident on South and Partlow Road. The EMS crew arrived to find a 49-year-old male sitting in the front passenger seat of a vehicle that was damaged in a rear-end collision and appeared to have minimal damage. He was wearing a seatbelt and he denied loss of consciousness. He also denied a pertinent past medical history. They noted pain in the lower cervical area, mid thoracic and lumbar area. They placed him on a backboard and transported him to Medical Center.,October 4, 2000: He was seen in the emergency department of Medical Center. The provider is described as ""unknown."" The history from the patient was that he was the passenger in the front seat of a car that was stopped and rear-ended. He stated that he did not exit the car because of pain in his upper back. He reported he had been wearing the seatbelt and harness at that time. He denied a history of back or neck injuries. He was examined on a board and had a cervical collar in place. He was complaining of mid back pain. He denied extremity weakness. Sensory examination was intact. There was no tenderness with palpation or flexion in the neck. The back was a little tender in the upper thoracic spine area without visible deformity. There were no marks on the back. His x-ray was described as ""no acute bony process."" Listed visit diagnosis was a sprain-thoracic, and he was prescribed hydrocodone/acetaminophen tablets and Motrin 800 mg tablets.,October 4, 2000: During the visit, a Clinician's Report of Disability document was signed by Dr. M, authorizing time loss from October 4, 2000, through October 8, 2000. The document also advised no heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, or overhead work for two weeks. During this visit, a thoracic spine x-ray series, two views, was obtained and read by Dr. JR. The findings demonstrate no evidence of acute injury. No notable arthritic findings. The pedicles and paravertebral soft tissues appear unremarkable.,November 21, 2000: An outpatient progress note was completed at Kaiser, and the clinician of record was Dr. H. The history obtained documents that Mr. Abc continued to experience the same pain that he first noted after the accident, described as a discomfort in the mid thoracic spine area. It was non-radiating and described as a tightness. He also reported that he was hearing clicking noises that he had not previously heard. He denied loss of strength in the arms. The physical examination revealed good strength and normal deep tendon reflexes in the arms. There was minimal tenderness over T4 through T8, in an approximate area. The visit diagnosis listed was back pain. Also described in the assessment was residual pain from MVA, suspected bruised muscles. He was prescribed Motrin 800 mg tablets and an order was sent to physical therapy. Dr. N also documents that if the prescribed treatment measures were not effective, then he would suggest a referral to a physiatrist. Also, the doctor wanted him to discuss with physical therapy whether or not they thought that a chiropractor would be beneficial.,December 4, 2000: He was seen at Kaiser for a physical therapy visit by Philippe Justel, physical therapist. The history obtained from Mr. Abc is that he was not improving. Symptoms described were located in the mid back, centrally. The examination revealed mild tenderness, centrally at T3-T8, with very poor segmental mobility. The posture was described as rigid T/S in flexion. Range of motion was described as within normal limits, without pain at the cervical spine and thoracic spine. The plan listed included two visits per week for two weeks, for mobilization. It is also noted that the physical therapist would contact the MD regarding a referral to a chiropractor.,December 8, 2000: He was seen at Kaiser for a physical therapy visit by Mr. Justel. It was noted that the subjective category of the document revealed that there was no real change. It was noted that Mr. Abc tolerated the treatment well and that he was to see a chiropractor on Monday.,December 11, 2000: He presented to the Chiropractic Wellness Center. There is a form titled 'Chiropractic Case History,' and it documents that Mr. Abc was involved in a motor vehicle accident, in which he was rear-ended in October. He has had mid back pain since that time. The pain is worsened with sitting, especially at a computer. The pain decreases when he changes positions, and sometimes when he walks. Mr. Abc reports that he occasionally takes 800 mg doses of ibuprofen. He reported he went to physical therapy treatment on two occasions, which helped for a few hours only. He did report that he had a previous history of transitory low back pain.,During the visit, he completed a modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and a WC/PI Subjective Complaint Form. He listed complaints of mid and low back pain of a sore and aching character. He rated the pain at grade 3-5/10, in intensity. He reported difficulty with sitting at a table, bending forward, or stooping. He reported that the pain was moderate and comes and goes.,During the visit at the Chiropractic Wellness Center, a spinal examination form was completed. It documents palpation tenderness in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine area and also palpation tenderness present in the suboccipital area, scalenes, and trapezia. Active cervical range of motion measured with goniometry reveals pain and restriction in all planes. Active thoracic range of motion measured with inclinometry revealed pain and restriction in rotation bilaterally. Active lumbosacral range of motion measured with inclinometry reveals pain with lumbar extension, right lateral flexion, and left lateral flexion.,December 11, 2000: He received chiropractic manipulation treatment, and he was advised to return for further treatment at a frequency of twice a week.,December 13, 2000: He returned to the Chiropractic Wellness Center to see Joe Smith, DC, and it is documented that his middle back was better.,December 13, 2000: A personal injury patient history form is completed at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. Mr. Abc reported that on October 4, 2000, he was driving his 1996 Volvo 850 vehicle, wearing seat and shoulder belt safety harnesses, and completely stopped. He was rear-ended by a vehicle traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour. The impact threw him back into his seat, and he felt back pain and determined that it was not wise to move about. He reported approximate damage to his vehicle of $4800. He reported continuing mid and low back pain, of a dull and semi-intense nature. He reported that he was an export company manager for IBIKEN-USA, and that he missed two full days of work, and missed 10-plus partial days of work. He stated that he was treated initially after the motor vehicle accident at Kaiser and received painkillers and ibuprofen, which relieved the pain temporarily. He specifically denied ever experiencing similar symptoms.,December 26, 2000: A no-show was documented at the Chiropractic Wellness Center.,April 5, 2001: He received treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. He reported that two weeks previously, his mid back pain had worsened.,April 12, 2001: He received chiropractic treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center.,April 16, 2001: He did not show up for his chiropractic treatment.,April 19, 2001: He did not show up for his chiropractic treatment.,April 26, 2001: He received chiropractic manipulation treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. He reported that his mid back pain increased with sitting at the computer. At the conclusion of this visit, he was advised to return to the clinic as needed.,September 6, 2002: An MRI of the thoracic spine was completed at ABCD Hospital and read by Dr. RL, radiologist. Dr. D noted the presence of minor anterior compression of some mid thoracic vertebrae of indeterminate age, resulting in some increased kyphosis. Some of the mid thoracic discs demonstrate findings consistent with degenerative disc disease, without a significant posterior disc bulging or disc herniation. There are some vertebral end-plate abnormalities, consistent with small Schmorl's nodes, one on the superior aspect of T7, which is compressed anteriorly, and on the inferior aspect of T6.,May 12, 2003: He was seen at the Outpatient Clinic by Dr. L, internal medicine specialist. He was there for a health screening examination, and listed that his only complaints are for psoriasis and chronic mid back pain, which have been present since a 2000 motor vehicle accident. Mr. Abc reported that an outside MRI showed compression fractures in the thoracic spine. The history further documents that Mr. Abc is an avid skier and volunteers on the ski patrol. The physical examination revealed that he was a middle-aged Caucasian male in no acute distress. The diagnosis listed from this visit is back pain and psoriasis. Dr. L documented that he spent one hour in the examination room with the patient discussing what was realistic and reasonable with regard to screening testing. Dr. L also stated that since Mr. Abc was experiencing chronic back pain, he advised him to see a physiatrist for evaluation. He was instructed to bring the MRI to the visit with that practitioner.,June 10, 2003: He was seen at the Physiatry Clinic by Dr. R, physiatrist. The complaint listed is mid back pain. In the subjective portion of the chart note, Dr. R notes that Mr. Abc is involved in the import/export business, and that he is physically active in cycling, skiing, and gardening. He is referred by Dr. L because of persistent lower thoracic pain, following a motor vehicle accident, on October 4, 2000. Mr. Abc told Dr. R that he was the restrained passenger of a vehicle that was rear-ended at a moderate speed. He stated that he experienced immediate discomfort in his thoracic spine area without radiation. He further stated that thoracic spine x-rays were obtained at the Sunnyside Emergency Room and read as normal. It is noted that Mr. Abc was treated conservatively and then referred to physical therapy where he had a number of visits in late of 2002 and early 2003. No further chart entries were documented about the back problem until Mr. Abc complained to Dr. L that he still had ongoing thoracic spine pain during a visit the previous month. He obtained an MRI, out of pocket, at ABCD Hospital and stated that he paid $1100 for it. Dr. R asked to see the MRI and was told by Mr. Abc that he would have to reimburse or pay him $1100 first. He then told the doctor that the interpretation was that he had a T7 and T8 compression fracture. Mr. Abc reported his improvement at about 20%, compared to how he felt immediately after the accident. He described that his only symptoms are an aching pain that occurs after sitting for four to five hours. If he takes a break from sitting and walks around, his symptoms resolve. He is noted to be able to bike, ski, and be active in his garden without any symptoms at all. He denied upper extremity radicular symptoms. He denied lower extremity weakness or discoordination. He also denied bowel or bladder control or sensation issues. Dr. R noted that Mr. Abc was hostile about the Kaiser health plan and was quite uncommunicative, only reluctantly revealing his history. The physical examination revealed that he moved about the examination room without difficulty and exhibited normal lumbosacral range of motion. There was normal thoracic spine motion with good chest expansion. Neurovascular examination of the upper extremities was recorded as normal. There was no spasticity in the lower extremities. There was no tenderness to palpation or percussion up and down the thoracic spine. Dr. R reviewed the thoracic spine films and noted the presence of ""a little compression of what appears to be T7 and T8 on the lateral view."" Dr. R observed that this was not noted on the original x-ray interpretation. He further stated that the MRI, as noted above, was not available for review. Dr. R assessed that Mr. Abc was experiencing minimal thoracic spine complaints that probably related to the motor vehicle accident three years previously. The doctor further stated that ""the patient's symptoms are so mild as to almost not warrant intervention."" He discussed the need to make sure that Mr. Abc's workstation was ergonomic and that Mr. Abc could pursue core strengthening. He further recommended that Mr. Abc look into participation in a Pilates class. Mr. Abc was insistent, so Dr. R made plans to order a bone scan to further discriminate the etiology of his symptoms. He advised Mr. Abc that the bone scan results would probably not change treatment. As a result of this visit, Dr. R diagnosed thoracic spine pain (724.1) and ordered a bone scan study.nan"

Need for durable central intravenous access.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,PROCEDURE:,  Placement of left subclavian 4-French Broviac catheter.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a toddler admitted with a limp and back pain, who was eventually found on bone scan and septic workup to have probable osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine at disk areas.  The patient needs prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, but attempt at a PICC line failed.  She has exhausted most of her easy peripheral IV access routes and referral was made to the Pediatric Surgery Service for Broviac placement.  I met with the patient's mom.  With the help of a Spanish interpreter, I explained the technique for Broviac placement.  We discussed the surgical risks and alternatives, most of which have been exhausted.  All their questions have been answered, and the patient is fit for operation today.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of the patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were here to place the Broviac catheter.  Preparation and draping of her skin was performed with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then an infraclavicular approach to left subclavian vein was performed.  A flexible guidewire was inserted into the central location and then a 4-French Broviac catheter was tunneled through the subcutaneous tissues and exiting on the right anterolateral chest wall well below and lateral to the breast and pectoralis major margins.  The catheter was brought to the subclavian insertion site and trimmed so that the tip would lie at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium based on fluoroscopic guidelines.  The peel-away sheath was passed over the guidewire and then the 4-French catheter was deployed through the peel-away sheath.  There was easy blood return and fluoroscopic imaging showed initially the catheter had transited across the mediastinum up the opposite subclavian vein, then it was withdrawn and easily replaced in the superior vena cava.  The catheter insertion site was closed with one buried 5-0 Monocryl stitch and the same 5-0 Monocryl was used to tether the catheter at the exit site until fibrous ingrowth of the attached cuff has occurred.  Heparinized saline solution was used to flush the line.  A sterile occlusive dressing was applied, and the line was prepared for immediate use.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no intraoperative complications, and her blood loss was between 5 and 10 mL during the line placement portion of the procedure.pediatrics - neonatal, lumbar osteomyelitis, central intravenous access, subclavian, osteomyelitis, broviac catheter, catheter, toddler, intravenous,"

He has elected to undergo radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Deep venous thrombosis.,6.  Recurrence of the cancer.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area.  Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered.  The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed.  The rectus fascia was opened sharply.  The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly.  Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed.  The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched.  The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder.  Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips.  The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section.  The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors.  The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply.  The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area.  The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle.  The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra was then identified and was dissected out.  The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly.  2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later.  The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected.  The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides.  The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply.  No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time.  The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily.  Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely.  The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected.  The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles.  Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen.  The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact.  It was sent for permanent section.  The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels.  The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck.  Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck.  A 20-French Foley Catheter was used.  The anterior sutures were then placed.  The Foley was then inflated.  The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly.  Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight.  Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces.  These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed.  The fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  Skin was approximated by using metallic clips.
